# Conjugation of to be

## Welcome to the course!

The following grammar will be quite thorough but its essential to understand for learning Interslavic in case you are not slavic since you won't understand the logic behind the phrases very well.

But in case you speak a slavic language and you know how to use byti, how to detemine the gender of a word and the rest of the basics explained here, feel free to skip to the exercises.

## Conjugation of 'Byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (**byti**) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Like in many languages, its present tense forms are a bit special, but they are easy to learn. 
You use these to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to say where something is located.

* Ja **jesm** (I am)
* Ty **jesi** (You are, singular)
* On/Ona/Ono **jest** (He/She/It is)
* My **jesmo** (We are)
* Vy **jeste** (You are, plural or formal)
* Oni/One **sut** (They(male/neuter) are/They(female) are)

* *Examples:* Ja **jesm** student (I am a student). Moja sestra **jest** dobra (My sister is good). My **jesmo** dobri prijatelji (We are good friends). Oni **sut** tu (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Interslavic nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is important because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. 
Usually, the gender is clear from the noun's ending in its basic (nominative singular) form:

* **Masculine:** Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., **dom** - house, **stol** - table, **učitelj** - teacher).
* **Feminine:** Most nouns ending in -**a** or -**ja** are feminine (e.g., **žena** - woman, **kniga** - book, **zemlja** - land).
* **Neuter:** Most nouns ending in -**o** or -**e** are neuter (e.g., **selo** - village, **okno** - window, **solnce** - sun).

* *Keep in mind:* There are some exceptions, but these rules cover most words!

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The **Nominative case** is the fundamental form of a noun or adjective, used mainly for the subject of a sentence (who or what is doing the action) or simply for naming things. It's the form you'll find words listed under in dictionaries.

* **Nouns:** Singular forms follow the gender rules (consonant for M, -a/-ja for F, -o/-e for N). Plural nouns often end in -**y** or -**i** (hard/soft).
    * *Hard:* Sg: **dom** (m), **žena** (f), **selo** (n). Pl: **domy**, **ženy**, **sela**.
    * *Soft:* Sg: **muž** (m), **zemlja** (f), **polje** (n). Pl: **muži**, **zemlji**, **polja**.
* **Adjectives:** Agree in gender and number.
    * *Hard:* Sg: **dobry** (m), **dobra** (f), **dobro** (n). Pl: **dobri** (virile), **dobre** (non-virile).
    * *Soft:* Sg: **svěži** (m), **svěža** (f), **svěže** (n). Pl: **svěži** (virile), **svěže** (non-virile).
* *Examples:* **Dobry dom** jest stary (A good house is old). **Svěže polja** sut zelene (New fields are green). **Krasne ženy** govorjat (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us point out specific nouns, like saying "this" or "that." In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

* **Singular:** **toj** (m), **ta** (f), **to** (n) - (this/that)
* **Plural:** **ti** (m/n) - (these/those) **te** (non-virile) - (these/those)

* *Examples:* **Toj** dom jest veliky (This/That house is big). **Ta** kniga jest moja (This/That book is mine). **To** jest naše selo (This/That is our village). **Ti** ljudi sut veseli (These/Those people are cheerful).

## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily shows *with whom* or *with what* an action is done, or *by means of what*. It's always used with a preposition (most commonly **s** - with) or after certain verbs, 
including **jest** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state.

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masc/Neuter:* hard **-om**, soft **-em**. (e.g., s brat**om** - with a brother, s učitel**em** - with a teacher, s sel**om** - with a village, s polj**em** - with a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-oju**, soft **-eju**. (e.g., s sestr**oju** - with a sister, s zemlj**eju** - with land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* hard/soft **-ami**. (e.g., s brat**ami** - with brothers, s učitelj**ami** - with teachers, s sestr**ami** - with sisters, s sel**ami** - with villages)
* **Adjectives:**
    * *Singular Masc/Neuter:* hard **-ym**, soft **-im**. (e.g., s dobr**ym** bratom - with a good brother, s svěž**im** učiteljem - with a fresh teacher)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-oju**, soft **-eju**. (e.g., s dobr**oju** sestroju - with a good sister, s svěž**oju** zemleju - with fresh land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* hard/soft **-ymi**. (e.g., s dobr**ymi** bratanami - with good brothers, s svěž**ymi** učiteljami - with fresh teachers)
* *Examples:* Idem **s prijateljem** (I am going with a friend). Oni govorjat **s nami** (They are talking with us). Pišem **perom** (I am writing with a pen). Ona jest **dobroju studentkoju** (She is a good student). My jesmo **dobrymi studentami** (We are good students).

## Two Main Verb Conjugations (Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, most imperfective verbs follow one of two main patterns for their endings, depending on the verb's stem.

* **Conjugation 1 (often -a- stem):** Includes verbs like **čitati** (to read), **dělati** (to do). 'Ja' ends in -m, 'ty' in -š, etc.
    * *Example: čitati* -> Ja čita**m** (I read/am reading), Ty čita**š** (You read/are reading), On/Ona/Ono čita (He/She/It reads/is reading), My čita**mo** (We read/are reading), Vy čita**te** (You read/are reading), Oni/One čita**jut** (They read/are reading).
* **Conjugation 2 (often -i-/-ě- stem):** Includes verbs like **govoriti** (to speak), **viděti** (to see). 'Ja' often ends in -im (with possible consonant changes), 'ty' in -iš, etc.
    * *Example: govoriti* -> Ja govori**m** (I speak/am speaking), Ty govori**š** (You speak/are speaking), On/Ona/Ono govori (He/She/It speaks/is speaking), My govori**mo** (We speak/are speaking), Vy govori**te** (You speak/are speaking), Oni/Ony govor**et** (They speak/are speaking).

## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). 
The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **v** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masc Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like Nominative. (e.g., Vidim **dom** - I see a house, Vidim **selo** - I see a village)
    * *Feminine:* End in -**u** or -**ju**. (e.g., Vidim **ženu** - I see a woman, Vidim **zemju** - I see land)
* **Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):**
    * *Masc/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, v **polju** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Often end in **-ě** or **-i**(soft ending). (e.g., na **rěkě** - on a river, na **zemji** - on land)
* *Examples:* Čitam **knigu** (I am reading a book). Sidim **na stolu** (We are sitting on a table).

## The Proper Accusative Case: The Direct Object

The **Accusative case** is the case of the direct object, showing the person or thing that is directly affected by the verb's action (e.g., "I see *him*", "She reads *a book*"). 
Its forms depend on gender, number, and whether a masculine noun is animate (living) or inanimate (non-living).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masc Inan/Neuter:* Same as Nominative (consonant/-o/-e, soft endings). (e.g., Vidim **dom** - I see a house, Vidim **selo** - I see a village)
    * *Singular Masc Animate:* Same as Genitive (hard/soft **-a**). (e.g., Vidim **otca** - I see a father, Vidim **muža** - I see a man)

    * *Singular Masc Animate:* Same as Genitive Sg (hard **-ogo**, soft **-ego**). (e.g., Vidim **starogo** otca - I see an old father, Vidim **svěžego** muža - I see a fresh man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-u**, soft **-u**. (e.g., Vidim **novu** knigu - I see a new book, Vidim **svězu** zemju - I see fresh land)
    * *Plural Masc Inan/Fem/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural (hard/soft -y/-i/-e). (e.g., Vidim **stare** domy - I see old houses, Vidim **svěže** knigy - I see fresh books, Vidim **stare** sela - I see old villages)
    * *Plural Masc Animate:* Same as Genitive Plural (hard/soft **-yh/-ih**). (e.g., Vidim **staryh** otcov - I see old fathers, Vidim **svěžih** mužev - I see fresh men)

## The Genitive Case: Possession, Absence, and More

The **Genitive case** indicates possession (like 'of' or 's), absence (with **bez** - without), origin (with **iz** - from), or location near/possession ('at' or 'have' with **u**).
Its main role is showing belonging or relation, or being required by certain prepositions.

    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-y** or **-i**, soft **-i**. (e.g., kniga sestr**y** - sister's book, golos zemj**i** - voice of the land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* Varies, often **-ov** (masc hard), **-ev** (masc soft), or a **zero ending** (feminine, neuter, some masc). (e.g., dom brat**ov** - brothers' house, kniga učitelj**ev** - teachers' book, kniga žen**∅** - women's book, okno sel**∅** - village windows, cvětky polj**ev** - field flowers)

* *Prepositions:* Used after **bez** (without), **iz** (from), **u** (at/by/have), and others like **do** (to/until), **ot** (from).
* *Examples:* To jest rabota **mojego otca** (This is my father's work). Ja jesm **iz grada** (I am from the city). **U mně** jest časovnik (I have a watch - literally "At me there is a watch"). Oni jedut **bez vody** (They are going without water). Viděl jesm mnogo **krasnyh žen** (I saw many beautiful women).

# Studying & Writing

## The Proper Locative Case: Location and Topic

The **Locative case** specifies location ('in', 'on', 'at') or the topic of discussion ('about'). It is unique because it is *always* used with a preposition, such as **v** (in), **na** (on), or **o** (about).

For instance 8:45 -> o osmoj časině četyrideset pet

# Talking about Time

## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past is done using the simple past tense. This is formed using a conjugated form of byti and the verb's past participle, which ends in **-l**. 
The ending of this '-l form' changes to match the gender and number of the subject. 


The form of to be can be omitted for the third person singular and plural.
* Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    * Masculine Singular: -**l** (On čita**l**)
    * Feminine Singular: -**la** (Ona čita**la**)
    * Neuter Singular: -**lo** (Ono čita**lo**)
    * All Plural: -**li** (Oni/One čita**li**)

* *Examples:* Včera jesm **rabotal** (masc.) (Yesterday i worked). Včera ona **rabotala** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My jesmo **viděli** film (We saw a film). Oni **pribyli** pozdno (They arrived late).


# Seasons of the year

## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining a future form of the verb **byti** ('to be') with the infinitive (the base form, ending in **-ti**) of the main verb.

* Future 'Byti': **budu, budeš, budet, budemo, budete, budut**
* *Formation:* Future 'byti' form + Infinitive of main verb

* *Examples:* Ja **budu čitati** knigu (I will read a book). Ty **budeš govoriti** s nim (You will speak with him). Ona **bude rabotati** jutro (She will work tomorrow). My **budemo pisati** (We will write). Oni **budut gledati** film (They will watch a film).

# Clothes

## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'ili', 'a'

Conjunctions are like glue words that connect words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja **i** ty - I and you. Čitam **i** pišu - I read and write.)
* **ili:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava **ili** čaj? - Coffee or tea? Pridete **ili** ostanete doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
* **a:** Means "but" when showing contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On jest učitelj, **a** ona jest studentka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idu, **a** ty ostaniješ - I am going, and you are staying.)

# Character  (Conditional)

## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-l form**) followed by the conjugated conditional particle **by**. 
The particle **by** often appears after the subject or the verb.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + conjugated form of **by**  (byh, bsy, by, byhmo, byste, by)

* *Examples:* Ja **čital byh** (m.) / **čitala byh** (f.) tu knigų (I would read that book). On **išel by** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **dělali byhmo** to vsi zajedno (We would do that all together). čto **byste** **hotěli**? (What would you like? - using past tense plural for 'vy')

# Emotions

## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* dobro (well, from dobry - good), brzo (quickly, from brzy - quick), tiho (quietly, from tihy - quiet), daleko (far).
* *In sentences:* On govori **dobro** (He speaks well). Ona běga **brzo** (She runs quickly). Živemo **daleko** (We live far away).

# Physical Appearance

## Easy Comparisons: Vyše and Než

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'better', 'bigger') followed by the word **než** (than).
The word **vyše** literally means 'higher' or 'above' and can be used when comparing physical height or level, or sometimes more abstractly. You can also use **najvyše** instead for the superlatives but it isn't part of the next exercise.

* *Using než:* Moja kniga jest vyše interesna **než** tvoja (My book is more interesting than yours). On jest vyše stary **než** ja (He is older than me).
* *Using vyše:* Ta gora jest **vyše** tamtogo holma (That mountain is higher than that hill). On skočil **vyše** měra (He jumped higher than the mark).
