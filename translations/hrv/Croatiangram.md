# Conjugation of to be

## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Croatian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'biti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (**biti**) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The present tense forms are:

* Ja **sam** (I am)
* Ti **si** (You are, singular informal)
* On/Ona/Ono **je** (He/She/It is)
* Mi **smo** (We are)
* Vi **ste** (You are, plural or singular formal)
* Oni/One **su** (They are)

* *Examples:* Ja **sam** student (I am a student). Moja sestra **je** dobra (My sister is good). Mi **smo** dobri prijatelji (We are good friends). Oni **su** ovdje (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Croatian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

* **Masculine:** Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., **dom** - house, **stol** - table, **učitelj** - teacher).
* **Feminine:** Most nouns ending in -**a** or -**ija** are feminine (e.g., **žena** - woman, **knjiga** - book, **zemlja** - earth/land, **policija** - police).
* **Neuter:** Most nouns ending in -**o** or -**e** are neuter (e.g., **selo** - village, **proljeće** - spring).

* *Keep in mind:* There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The **Nominative case** is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

* **Nouns:** Singular forms follow the gender rules (consonant for M, -a/-ija for F, -o/-e for N). Plural nouns often end in -**i**, -**e**, or -**a**.
    * *Examples:* Singular: **dom** (m), **žena** (f), **selo** (n). Plural: **domovi**, **žene**, **sela**.
* **Adjectives:** Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    * *Hard Stem Examples:* Singular: **dobar** (m), **dobra** (f), **dobro** (n). Plural: **dobri** (all genders).
    * *Soft Stem Examples:* Singular: **nježan** (m), **nježna** (f), **nježno** (n). Plural: **nježni** (all genders).
* *Examples:* **Dobar dom** je star (A good house is old). **Nježno cvijeće** je lijepo (Tender flowers are beautiful). **Lijepe žene** govore (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

* **Singular:** **ovaj** (m), **ova** (f), **ovo** (n) - (this, close to the speaker) / **taj** (m), **ta** (f), **to** (n) - (that, close to the listener) / **onaj** (m), **ona** (f), **ono** (n) - (that, far from both)
* **Plural:** **ovi** (all genders) - (these) / **ti** (all genders) - (those) / **oni** (all genders) - (those, far)

* *Examples:* **Ovaj** dom je velik (This house is big). **Ta** knjiga je moja (That book is mine). **Ono** je naše selo (That is our village). **Ovi** ljudi su veseli (These people are cheerful).

# Family

## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily indicates *s kim* or *čim* an action is performed, or *čime*. It is always used with a preposition (most commonly **s/sa** - with) or after certain verbs, including the verb **biti** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state.

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-om**. (e.g., s bratom - with a brother, s učitelj**em** - with a teacher, sa sel**om** - with a village, s polj**em** - with a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-om**. (e.g., sa sestrom - with a sister, sa zemlj**om** - with land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* ending **-ima**. (e.g., s bratov**ima** - with brothers, s učitelj**ima** - with teachers, sa sestrama - with sisters, sa sel**ima** - with villages)
* **Adjectives:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-im**. (e.g., s dobr**im** bratom - with a good brother, s nježn**im** učitelj**em** - with a tender teacher)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-om**. (e.g., s dobrom sestrom - with a good sister, s nježn**om** žen**om** - with a tender woman)
    * *Plural (all genders):* ending **-im**. (e.g., s dobr**im** bratov**ima** - with good brothers, s nježn**im** učitelj**ima** - with tender teachers)
* *Examples:* Idem **s prijateljem** (I am going with a friend). Oni razgovaraju **s nama** (They are talking with us). Pišem **olovkom** (I am writing with a pen). Ona je **dobra studentica** (She is a good student - present tense of 'to be' included). Mi smo **dobri studenti** (We are good students - present tense of 'to be' included).

## Verb Conjugations (Present Tense - Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, Croatian verbs have several conjugation patterns based on their stem and infinitive ending.

## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **u** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidim **stol** - I see a table, Vidim **selo** - I see a village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim **oca** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-u**. (e.g., Vidim **ženu** - I see a woman, Vidim **knjigu** - I see a book)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'na/u' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, u **gradu** - in a city, na **polju** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-i**. (e.g., na **reci** - on a river, u **zemlji** - in the earth, u **školi** - in a school)
* *Examples:* Čitam **knjigu** (I am reading a book). Sjedimo **na stolu** (We are sitting on a table).

## The Proper Accusative Case: The Direct Object

The **Accusative case** is the case of the direct object, indicating the person or thing directly affected by the verb's action (e.g., "I see *him*", "She reads *a book*"). Its forms depend on gender, number, and whether a masculine noun is animate (living) or inanimate (non-living).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative (consonant/-o/-e). (e.g., Vidim **stol** - I see a table, Vidim **grad** - I see a city, Vidim **proljeće** - I see spring)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim **oca** - I see a father, Vidim **muža** - I see a man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-u**. (e.g., Vidim **knjigu** - I see a book, Vidim **zemlju** - I see the earth)
    * *Plural Masculine Inanimate/Feminine/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural (-i/-e/-a). (e.g., Vidim **stolove** - I see tables, Vidim **knjige** - I see books, Vidim **sela** - I see villages)
    * *Plural Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Plural (-a). (e.g., Vidim **očeva** - I see fathers, Vidim **muškaraca** - I see men)
* **Adjectives:** Follow the rules of the noun they modify. Hard stem adjectives use hard endings, soft stem adjectives use soft endings.
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Singular (hard -ar/-a/-o, soft -an/-a/-o). (e.g., Vidim **stari** dom - I see an old house, Vidim **nježn**o polje - I see a tender field)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Singular (hard **-og(a)**, soft **-eg(a)**). (e.g., Vidim **starog(a)** oca - I see an old father, Vidim **nježnog(a)** muškarca - I see a tender man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-u**. (e.g., Vidim **novu** knjig**u** - I see a new book, Vidim **nježnu** žen**u** - I see a tender woman)
    * *Plural Masculine Inanimate/Feminine/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural (hard -i/-e/-a, soft -i/-e/-a). (e.g., Vidim **stare** domove - I see old houses, Vidim **nježne** knjige - I see tender books)
    * *Plural Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Plural (hard **-ih**, soft **-ih**). (e.g., Vidim **starih** očeva - I see old fathers, Vidim **nježnih** muškaraca - I see tender men)

## The Genitive Case: Possession, Absence, and More

The **Genitive case** indicates possession (like 'of' or 's), absence (with **bez** - without), origin (with **iz** - from), or location at/having ('at' or 'have' with **kod**). Its primary role is showing belonging or relation, or being required by certain prepositions.

* **Nouns:** Endings vary based on gender, number, and hard/soft stem.
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-a**. (e.g., dom brat**a** - brother's house, knjiga učitelj**a** - teacher's book, prozor sel**a** - village window, cvijet polj**a** - field flower)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., knjiga sestr**e** - sister's book, glas zemlj**e** - voice of the earth)
    * *Plural (all genders):* Variable, often **-a** or **-i**. (e.g., domovi brać**e** - brothers' houses, knjige učitelj**a** - teachers' books, knjige žen**a** - women's books, prozori sel**a** - village windows, cvjetovi polj**a** - field flowers)
* **Adjectives:**

    * *Plural (all genders):* hard/soft **-ih**. (e.g., domovi dobr**ih** očeva - houses of good fathers, knjige nježn**ih** učitelja - books of tender teachers)
* *Prepositions:* Used after **bez** (without), **iz** (from), **kod** (at/by/have), and others like **do** (to/until), **od** (from).
* *Examples:* To je posao **mojeg oca** (This is my father's work). Ja sam **iz grada** (I am from the city). **Kod mene** je sat (I have a watch - literally "At me there is a watch"). Oni idu **bez vode** (They are going without water). Vidio sam mnogo **lijepih žena** (I saw many beautiful women).

# Studying & Writing

## The Proper Locative Case: Location and Topic

The **Locative case** (Prepositional) specifies location ('in', 'on', 'at') or the topic of discussion ('about'). It is unique because it is *always* used with a preposition, such as **u** (in), **na** (on), or **o** (about).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* Ending **-u**. (e.g., u dom**u** - in a house, o mužu - about a man, u sel**u** - in a village, o polj**u** - about a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* Common ending is **-i**. (e.g., na rjec**i** - on a river, o sestri - about a sister, na zemlj**i** - on the earth)
    * *Plural (all genders):* Often ends in **-ima**. (e.g., u domov**ima** - in houses, o muškarc**ima** - about men, u sel**ima** - in villages, na rijek**ama** - on rivers)
* **Adjectives:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-om** (hard) / **-om** (soft). (e.g., u dobr**om** domu - in a good house, o nježn**om** muškarcu - about a tender man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-oj**. (e.g., na dobr**oj** rijeci - on a good river, o nježn**oj** ženi - about a tender woman)

## The Dative Case: To Whom? For Whom?

The **Dative case** is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb – **komu** or **za koga** an action is done. It is also used after certain verbs and prepositions. Its main purpose is to show the recipient of something or the beneficiary of an action.

* **Nouns:** Endings change based on gender, number, and hard/soft stem.
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* **-u**. (e.g., bratu - to a brother, dajem učitelj**u** - I give to a teacher, sel**u** - to a village, polj**u** - to a field).
    * *Singular Feminine:* **-i**. (e.g., sestri - to a sister, zemlji - to land).

* 4 četiri
* 5 pet
* 6 šest
* 7 sedam
* 8 osam
* 9 devet
* 10 deset

*Grammar note:* The case of the noun following the numbers changes. For 1, it's Nominative singular. For 2, 3, and 4, it's Nominative plural. For 0 and numbers from 5 upwards, it's Genitive plural.

* *Examples:* tri kuće (Nominative plural) - three houses, nula kuć**a** (Genitive plural) - zero houses, jedan dom (Nominative singular) - one house, dva doma (Nominative plural) - two houses, pet kuć**a** (Genitive plural) - five houses.

# Numbers 11-20

## The numbers from 10 to 20 are these:
* 10 deset
* 11 jedanaest
* 12 dvanaest
* 13 trinaest
* 14 četrnaest
* 15 petnaest
* 16 šesnaest
* 17 sedamnaest
* 18 osamnaest
* 19 devetnaest
* 20 dvadeset

These numbers always require the Genitive plural case for the following noun.

* *Example:* sedamnaest kuć**a** (Genitive plural) - seventeen houses.

# Numbers 10-100

## The numbers from 10 to 100 are these:
* 10 deset

* 40 četrdeset
* 50 pedeset
* 60 šezdeset
* 70 sedamdeset
* 80 osamdeset
* 90 devedeset
* 100 sto

The case of the following noun depends on the last digit of the number (except for 11-19, which always take Genitive plural).

* *Examples:* 83 psa (Nominative plural) - eighty-three dogs (governed by 'tri'), 41 pas**a** (Genitive plural) - forty-one dogs (governed by 'jedan').

# Numbers 100-1000

## The numbers from 100 to 1000 are these:
* 100 sto
* 200 dvjesto

* *Example:* 1232 psa (Nominative plural) - one thousand two hundred thirty-two dogs (governed by 'dva').

# Ordinal Numbers

## The ordinal numbers from 1 to 1000 are these:
* 1 prvi
* 2 drugi
* 3 treći
* 4 četvrti
* 5 peti
* 6 šesti
* 7 sedmi
* 8 osmi
* 9 deveti
* 100 stoti
* 1000 tisućiti

Like in the Interslavic explanation, these function grammatically like adjectives and decline accordingly.

To state the time of day, you typically use the preposition **u** followed by the ordinal number in the Locative case and the word **sati** (Locative case of "sat" - hour).

* *Example:* 8:45 -> u osm**i** sati četrdeset pet minuta - at eight forty-five.

# Talking about Time

## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense (perfekt). This is formed using the present tense forms of the verb **biti** ('to be') and the past active participle of the main verb, which ends in **-o** (masculine singular), **-la** (feminine singular), **-lo** (neuter singular), or **-li** (plural).

* Formation: Present tense of 'biti' + Past active participle (-o/-la/-lo/-li)

* *Examples:* Jučer **sam radio** (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Jučer **je radila** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). Mi **smo vidjeli** film (We saw a film). Oni **su stigli** kasno (They arrived late).

# Seasons of the year

## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it using the future tense forms of **biti** ('to be') and the infinitive of the main verb.

* Future forms of 'biti': **ću, ćeš, će, ćemo, ćete, će** (short forms, most common) or **hoću, hoćeš, hoće, hoćemo, hoćete, hoće** (long forms).
* Formation: Future 'biti' form + Infinitive of main verb

* *Examples:* Ja **ću čitati** knjigu (I will read a book). Ti **ćeš govoriti** s njim (You will talk with him). Ona **će raditi** sutra (She will work tomorrow). Mi **ćemo pisati** (We will write). Oni **će gledati** film (They will watch a film).

## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'a', 'ili'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja **i** ti - I and you. Čitam **i** pišem - I read and write.)
* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On je učitelj, **a** ona je studentica - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idem, **a** ti ostaješ - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **ili:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava **ili** čaj? - Coffee or tea? Hoćete li doći **ili** ostati kod kuće? - Will you come or stay at home?)

# Character

## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood (kondicional I). This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb **biti** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-o/-la/-lo/-li** form).

* Conditional forms of 'biti': **bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi**
* Formation: Conditional 'biti' form + Past active participle (-o/-la/-lo/-li)

* *Examples:* Ja **bih čitao** (m.) / **bih čitala** (f.) tu knjigu (I would read that book). On **bi išao** u kino (He would go to the cinema). Mi **bismo radili** to sve zajedno (We would do that all together). Što **biste htjeli**? (What would you like?).

# Emotions

## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-ki/-ški/-čki**.

* *Examples:* dobro (well, from dobar - good), brzo (quickly, from brz - quick), tiho (quietly, from tih - quiet), daleko (far).
* *In sentences:* On govori **dobro** (He speaks well). Ona trči **brzo** (She runs quickly). Živimo **daleko** (We live far away).

## Easy Comparisons: Više and Nego/Od

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'bolji' - better, 'veći' - bigger) followed by the word **nego** or **od** (than). The word **više** generally means 'more' or 'a greater amount' and can be used with nouns in the genitive case or as a comparative adverb. It's also the comparative form of 'visok' (tall/high) in some contexts, but 'viši' is the standard comparative adjective form.

* *Using nego:* Moja knjiga je zanimljivija **nego** tvoja (My book is more interesting than yours). On je stariji **nego** ja (He is older than me).
* *Using od:* Moja knjiga je zanimljivija **od** tvoje (My book is more interesting than yours). On je stariji **od** mene (He is older than me).
* *Using viši/više:* Ta planina je **viša** nego ono brdo (That mountain is higher than that hill). On je skočio **više** od norme (He jumped more than the norm).
