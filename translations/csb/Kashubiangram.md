# Conjugation of to be

## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Kashubian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'bëc' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (**bëc**) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located.

* **Singular:**
    * Jô **jãm** (I am)
    * Të **jãsz** (You are, singular informal)
    * Òn/Òna/Òno **je** (He/She/It is)
* **Plural:**
    * Më **jãmë** (We are)
    * Wë **jãce** (You are, plural or singular formal)
    * Òni/Òne **sã** (They are)

* *Examples:* Jô **jãm** sztudént (I am a student). Mòja sostra **je** dobrô (My sister is good). Më **jãmë** dobri kamraci (We are good friends). Òni **sã** tu (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Kashubian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

* **Masculine:** Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., **dom** - house, **stół** - table, **ùczëcel** - teacher).
* **Feminine:** Most nouns ending in -**a** or -**ô** are feminine (e.g., ** białka** - woman, **knéga** - book, **zemia** - earth/land).
* **Neuter:** Most nouns ending in -**o** or -**e** are neuter (e.g., **wòkno** - window, **pòle** - field).

* *Keep in mind:* There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The **Nominative case** is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

* **Nouns:** Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural forms vary based on gender.
    * *Masculine Examples:* Sg: **dom**. Pl: **domë**.
    * *Feminine Examples:* Sg: ** białka**. Pl: ** białczi**.
    * *Neuter Examples:* Sg: **wòkno**. Pl: **wòkna**.
* **Adjectives:** Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    * *Hard Stem Examples:* Singular: **dobri** (m), **dobrô** (f), **dobré** (n). Plural: **dobri** (masculine personal), **dobré** (other genders/non-masculine personal).
    * *Soft Stem Examples:* Singular: **juńdżi** (m), **juńdżô** (f), **juńdzé** (n). Plural: **juńdżi** (masculine personal), **juńdzé** (other genders/non-masculine personal).
* *Examples:* **Dobri dom** je stôri (A good house is old). **Juńdzé pòla** sã zeléne (Other fields are green). **Pòkné białczi** gôdają (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

* **Singular:** **tén** (m), **tô** (f), **to** (n) - (this/that)
* **Plural:** **ci** (masculine personal), **té** (other genders/non-masculine personal) - (these/those)

* *Examples:* **Tén** dom je wiôldżi (This/That house is big). **Tô** knéga je mòja (This/That book is mine). **To** je najszé pòle (This/That is our field). **Ci** lëdze sã weseli (These/Those people are cheerful).

## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily indicates *z kim* or *z czim* an action is performed, or *czim*. It is always used with a preposition (most commonly **z/za/ze** - with) or after certain verbs, including the verb **bëc** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state.

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-ã** or **-em**. (e.g., z brat**ã** - with a brother, z ùczëcél**em** - with a teacher, z séł**ã** - with a village, z pòl**ã** - with a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-ą** or **-ô**. (e.g., z sostrą - with a sister, z zemią - with land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* ending **-ama** or **-oma** (dialectal **-ama**). (e.g., z brat**ama** - with brothers, z ùczëcél**ama** - with teachers, z sostr**ama** - with sisters, z séł**ama** - with villages)
* **Adjectives:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-im**, soft **-im**. (e.g., z dobr**im** brat**ã** - with a good brother, z juńdz**im** ùczëcél**em** - with a different teacher)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-ą**, soft **-ą**. (e.g., z dobr**ą** sostr**ą** - with a good sister, z juńdz**ą** zemią - with different land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* hard/soft **-ima**. (e.g., z dobr**ima** brat**ama** - with good brothers, z juńdz**ima** ùczëcél**ama** - with different teachers)
* *Examples:* Jdã **z kamratã** (I am going with a friend). Òni gôdają **z nama** (They are talking with us). Piszę **òłówkã** (I am writing with a pencil). Òna je **dobrą sztudéntkô** (She is a good student). Më jãmë **dobrima sztudéntama** (We are good students).

## Verb Conjugations (Present Tense - Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, Kashubian verbs follow various conjugation patterns.

* **-ac conjugation:** Includes verbs like **czëtac** (to read), **robic** (to do).
    * *Example: czëtac* -> Jô czët**óm** (I read/am reading), Të czët**ôsz**, Òn/Òna/Òno czët**ô**. Më czët**ómë**, Wë czët**ôce**, Òni/Òne czët**ają**.
* **-ec conjugation:** Includes verbs like **widzec** (to see), **mòwic** (to speak).
    * *Example: mòwic* -> Jô mòwi**ã** (I speak/am speaking), Të mòwi**sz**, Òn/Òna/Òno mòwi. Më mòwi**më**, Wë mòwi**ce**, Òni/Òne mòwi**ą**.

## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (kògò or co receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **w** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widzã **dom** - I see a house, Widzã **sélko** - I see a small village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widzã **òjca** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-ã** or **-ą**. (e.g., Widzã ** białkã** - I see a woman, Widzã **knégã** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'na/w' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, w **sélku** - in a small village)
    * *Feminine:* Often end in **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., na **rece** - on a river, na **zemi** - on land)
* *Examples:* Czëtóm **knégã** (I am reading a book - Accusative feminine ending). Sedzëma **na stolu** (We are sitting on a table).

## The Proper Accusative Case: The Direct Object

The **Accusative case** is the case of the direct object, indicating the person or thing directly affected by the verb's action (e.g., "I see *him*", "She reads *a book*"). Its forms depend on gender, number, and whether a masculine noun is animate (living) or inanimate (non-living).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative (consonant/-o/-e). (e.g., Widzã **dom** - I see a house, Widzã **sélko** - I see a small village)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widzã **òjca** - I see a father, Widzã **chłopa** - I see a man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-ã** or **-ą**. (e.g., Widzã **knégã** - I see a book, Widzã **zemiã** - I see land)
    * *Plural Masculine Inanimate/Feminine/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural (-e/-i). (e.g., Widzã **domë** - I see houses, Widzã **knédżi** - I see books, Widzã **séłka** - I see small villages)
    * *Plural Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Plural (-ów/-ew). (e.g., Widzã **òjców** - I see fathers, Widzã **chłopów** - I see men)
* **Adjectives:** Follow the rules of the noun they modify. Hard stem adjectives use hard endings, soft stem adjectives use soft endings.
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Singular (hard -i/-é, soft -i/-é). (e.g., Widzã **stôri** dom - I see an old house, Widzã **juńdzé** sélko - I see a different small village)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Singular (hard **-égò**, soft **-égò**). (e.g., Widzã **stôrégo** òjca - I see an old father, Widzã **juńdzégo** chłop**a** - I see a different man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-ą** or **-ô**. (e.g., Widzã **nową** knég**ã** - I see a new book, Widzã **juńdz**ą zemi**ã** - I see different land)
    * *Plural Masculine Inanimate/Feminine/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural (hard -é/-é, soft -é/-é). (e.g., Widzã **staré** domë - I see old houses, Widzã **juńdzé** knédżi - I see different books)
    * *Plural Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Plural (hard **-ich**, soft **-ich**). (e.g., Widzã **stôrich** òjców - I see old fathers, Widzã **juńdzich** chłopów - I see different men)
* *Examples:* Jô czëtóm **cékażą knégã** (I am reading an interesting book). Òn widzë **swòjégò òjca** (He sees his father). Më kùpiemë **nowé aùto** (We are buying a new car).

## The Genitive Case: Possession, Absence, and More

The **Genitive case** indicates possession (like 'of' or 's), absence (with **bez** - without), origin (with **z/ze** - from), or location at/having ('at' or 'have' with **ù**). Its primary role is showing belonging or relation, or being required by certain prepositions.

* **Nouns:** Endings vary based on gender and hard/soft stem.
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-a** or **-u**, soft **-a** or **-u**. (e.g., dom brat**a** - brother's house, knéga ùczëcél**a** - teacher's book, wòkno sélk**a** - small village window, cwiôt pòl**a** - field flower, cëkr**u** - sugar, snieg**u** - snow)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-ë** or **-i**. (e.g., knéga sostr**ë** - sister's book, głos zemi**i** - voice of the land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* Various endings, often **-ów** or **-ew** (masculine), or a **zero ending** (feminine and neuter). (e.g., domë brat**ów** - brothers' houses, knédżi ùczëcél**ew** - teachers' books, knédżi białk**∅** - women's books, wòkna séł**∅** - small village windows)
* **Adjectives:**

    * *Plural (all genders):* hard/soft **-ich**. (e.g., domë dobrich brat**ów** - houses of good brothers, knédżi juńdzich ùczëcél**ew** - books of different teachers)
* *Prepositions:* Used after **bez** (without), **z/ze** (from), **ù** (at/by/have), and others like **do** (to/until), **òd** (from).
* *Examples:* To je robòta **mòjégò òjca** (This is my father's work). Jô jãm **z gardu** (I am from the city). **Ù mie** je zegar (I have a watch - literally "At me there is a watch"). Òni jidą **bez wòdë** (They are going without water). Widza jem wiele **pòknich białków** (I saw many beautiful women).

# Studying & Writing

## The Proper Locative Case: Location and Topic

The **Locative case** is used for location ('in', 'on', 'at') or the topic of discussion ('about'). It is unique because it is *always* used with a preposition, such as **w/we** (in), **na** (on), or **ò/òb** (about).

    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* Ending **-u**. (e.g., w dom**u** - in a house, ò chłop**ie** - about a man, w sélk**u** - in a small village, ò pòl**u** - about a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* Common ending is **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., na rec**e** - on a river, ò sostrz**e** - about a sister, w zemi**i** - in the earth)
    * *Plural (all genders):* Often ends in **-ach** or **-ech**. (e.g., w dom**ach** - in houses, ò chłop**ach** - about men, w séłk**ach** - in small villages, na rek**ach** - on rivers)

## The Dative Case: To Whom? For Whom?

The **Dative case** is used to indicate the indirect object of a verb – **kòmù** or **dlô kògò** an action is done. It is also used after certain verbs and prepositions. Its main purpose is to show the recipient of something or the beneficiary of an action.

* **Nouns:** Endings change based on gender and hard/soft stem.
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-ù** or **-owi**, soft **-u** or **-ewi**. (e.g., brat**u** - to a brother, dóm ùczëcél**owi** - I give to a teacher, sélk**u** - to a small village, pòl**u** - to a field).

# Numbers 0-10

## The numbers from 0 to 10 are these:
* 0 null
* 1 jeden, jednô, jedno
* 2 dwa, dwie
* 3 trzë
* 4 sztërë
* 5 piãc
* 6 szesc
* 7 sétmë
* 8 òsmë
* 9 dzewiãc
* 10 dzesãc

*Grammar note:* The case of the noun following the numbers changes. For 1, it's Nominative singular. For 2, 3, and 4, the noun is in the Nominative plural. For 0 and numbers from 5 upwards, it's Genitive plural.

* *Examples:* trzë domë (Nominative plural) - three houses, null domów (Genitive plural) - zero houses, jeden dom (Nominative singular) - one house, dwa domë (Nominative plural) - two houses, piãc domów (Genitive plural) - five houses.

# Numbers 11-20

## The numbers from 10 to 20 are these:
* 10 dzesãc
* 11 jedenôscë
* 12 dwanôscë
* 13 trzinôscë
* 14 sztërnôscë
* 15 piãtnôscë
* 16 szesnôscë
* 17 sétmënôscë
* 18 òsmnôscë
* 19 dzewiãtnôscë
* 20 dwadzescãt

These numbers always require the Genitive plural case for the following noun.

* *Example:* sétmënôscë domów (Genitive plural) - seventeen houses.

# Numbers 10-100

## The numbers from 10 to 100 are these:
* 10 dzesãc
* 20 dwadzescãt
* 30 trzëdzescë
* 40 sztërëdzescë
* 50 piãcdzesãt
* 60 szescdzesãt
* 70 sétmëdzesãt
* 80 òsmdzesãt
* 90 dzewiãcdzesãt
* 100 sto

The case of the following noun depends on the last digit of the number (except for 11-19, which always take Genitive plural).

* *Examples:* 83 psë (Nominative plural) - eighty-three dogs (governed by 'trzë'), 41 psa (Genitive singular - governed by 'jeden') - forty-one dogs. (Note: Agreement here is complex and depends on the last digit).

# Numbers 100-1000

## The numbers from 100 to 1000 are these:
* 100 sto
* 200 dwie sta
* 300 trzë sta
* 400 sztërë sta
* 500 piãc set
* 600 szesc set
* 700 sétmë set
* 800 òsmë set
* 900 dzewiãc set
* 1000 tësãc

The case of the following noun depends on the last two digits (or last digit if it's 1, 2, 3, or 4 not preceded by 1).

* *Example:* 1232 psë (Nominative plural) - one thousand two hundred thirty-two dogs (governed by 'dwa').

# Ordinal Numbers

## The ordinal numbers from 1 to 1000 are these:
* 1 pierszi
* 2 drëdżi
* 3 trzeci
* 4 czwiôrti
* 5 piąti
* 6 szósti
* 7 sétmi
* 8 òsmi
* 9 dzewiąti
* 100 stëny
* 1000 tësącni

Like in the Interslavic explanation, these function grammatically like adjectives and decline accordingly.

To state the time of day, you typically use the preposition **òb** followed by the ordinal number in the Locative case and the word **gòdzënie**.

* *Example:* òb òsmi gòdzënie sztërëdzescë piãc - at eight forty-five.

# Talking about Time

## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense. In Kashubian, this is often formed using the past participle of the verb (ending in **-ł** for masculine singular, **-ła** for feminine singular, **-ło** for neuter singular, and **-lë** for plural) combined with the present tense of the auxiliary verb **miec** (to have) or sometimes **bëc** (to be), depending on the verb and dialect.

* Formation (common with 'miec'): Present of 'miec' (jô móm, të môsz, òn/òna/òno mô, më môme, wë môce, òni/òne mają) + Past participle (-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë).
* Formation (with 'bëc' for some verbs of motion/state): Present of 'bëc' (jô jãm, të jãsz, òn/òna/òno je, më jãmë, wë jãce, òni/òne sã) + Past participle (-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë).

* *Examples (with miec):* Westerdô **jô móm robił** (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Westerdô òna **mô robiła** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). Më **môme widzelë** film (We saw a film). Òni **mają przëszlë** pózdze (They arrived late).

# Seasons of the year

## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining the future tense of the verb **bëc** ('to be') with the infinitive of the main verb, or using the simple future for perfective verbs.

* Compound Future ('bëc' + Infinitive - for imperfective verbs): bùdã, bùdzesz, bùdze, bùdzemë, bùdzece, bùdą + Infinitive.
* Simple Future (for perfective verbs): Formed using the present tense conjugation of the perfective verb.

* *Examples (Compound Future - imperfective):* Jô **bùdã czëtac** knégã (I will read a book). Të **bùdzesz gôdac** z nim (You will talk with him). Òna **bùdze robic** jutrã (She will work tomorrow). Më **bùdzemë pisac** (We will write). Òni **bùdą kùkac** na film (They will watch a film).
* *Examples (Simple Future - perfective):* Jô **przeczëtóm** knégã (I will read a book). Të **pòwiesz** mù (You will tell him). Òna **zrobi** to (She will do it).

## Using Conjunctions: 'ë', 'a', 'abò'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **ë:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jô **ë** të - I and you. Czëtóm **ë** piszę - I read and write.)
* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Òn je ùczëcel, **a** òna je sztudéntka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jô jidã, **a** të òstajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **abò:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa **abò** téj? - Coffee or tea? Przëńdzece **abò** òstanace doma? - Will you come or stay at home?)

# Character

## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the particle **bë** (or **bëch**, **bës**, **bë**, etc., depending on dialect and person) combined with the past participle of the main verb (the **-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë** form).

* Formation: Conditional particle ('bë' or conjugated form) + Past participle (-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë)

* *Examples:* Jô **bëczëtôł** (masc.) / **bë czëtôła** (fem.) tą knégã (I would read that book). Òn **bë szedł** do kina (He would go to the cinema). Më **bë robilë** to wszëtkò razã (We would do that all together). Czë to **bë wë chcële**? (What would you like?).

# Emotions

## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* dobrze (well, from dobri - good), chùtczi (quickly, from chùtczi - quick), cëchò (quietly, from cëchi - quiet), dalekò (far).
* *In sentences:* Òn gôdô **dobrze** (He speaks well). Òna biégô **chùtczi** (She runs quickly). Mieszkómë **dalekò** (We live far away).

# Physical Appearance

## Easy Comparisons: Wëżi and Jak/ niż

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than' or 'taller/higher than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'lëpszi' - better, 'wiãcszi' - bigger) followed by the word **jak** or **niż** (than). The word **wëżi** is the comparative adverb of wësok (tall/high) and means 'higher' or 'taller'.

* *Using jak/niż:* Mòja knéga je cékaższô, **jak** twòja (My book is more interesting than yours). Òn je stôrszi, **niż** ja (He is older than me).
* *Using wëżi:* Ta góra je **wëżi** jak tién bùllôk (That mountain is higher than that hill). Òn skòcził **wëżi** jak norma (He jumped higher than the norm).
