# Conjugation of to be and the Nominative Case

## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Silesian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'być' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (**być**) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The forms for the present tense are:

* Jo **żech je** (I am) - *colloquial, common*
* Ty **żeś je** (You are, singular informal) - *colloquial, common*
* On/Ona/Ono **je** (He/She/It is)
* My **żeśmy są** (We are) - *colloquial, common*
* Wy **żeście są** (You are, plural or singular formal) - *colloquial, common*
* Oni/One **są** (They are)

Note that the colloquial forms with "że" are very common in spoken Silesian.

* *Examples:* Jo **żech je** studentym (I am a student). Moja siostra **je** dobra (My sister is good). My **żeśmy są** dobrzi kamraci (We are good friends). Łoni **są** sam (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Silesian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

* **Masculine:** Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., **dom** - house, **stół** - table, **ućytel** - teacher). Some nouns ending in -ś or -ź are masculine (e.g., **źyńś** - day).
* **Feminine:** Most nouns ending in -**a** or -**io** are feminine (e.g., **baba** - woman, **ksiůnżka** - book, **ziymia** - earth/land). Some nouns ending in a consonant are feminine (e.g., **nocka** - night).
* **Neuter:** Most nouns ending in -**o**, -**e**, or -**y**/-**i** are neuter (e.g., **ôkno** - window, **pole** - field, **szczyńści** - happiness).

* *Keep in mind:* There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The **Nominative case** is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

* **Nouns:** Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural nouns often end in -**y**/-**i** or -**a**.
    * *Examples:* Singular: **stół** (m), **baba** (f), **ôkno** (n). Plural: **stoły**, **baby**, **ôkna**.
* **Adjectives:** Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    * *Hard Stem Examples:* Singular: **dobry** (m), **dobra** (f), **dobre** (n). Plural: **dobry** (masculine personal), **dobre** (other genders/non-masculine personal).
    * *Soft Stem Examples:* Singular: **inšy** (m), **inšo** (f), **inše** (n). Plural: **inšy** (masculine personal), **inše** (other genders/non-masculine personal).
* *Examples:* **Dobry dom** je stary (A good house is old). **Zielone pola** sům zielone (Green fields are green). **Piynkne baby** gŏdajům (Beautiful women are speaking). **Inše ôkna** sům fechne (Other windows are cool).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

* **Singular:** **tyn** (m), **ta** (f), **to** (n) - (this/that)
* **Plural:** **ci** (masculine personal), **te** (other genders/non-masculine personal) - (these/those)

* *Examples:* **Tyn** dom je wielgi (This/That house is big). **Ta** ksiůnżka je moja (This/That book is mine). **To** je nasze pole (This/That is our field). **Ci** ludzie sům wieseli (These/Those people are cheerful).

# Family (Instrumental case)

## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily indicates *s kim* or *czym* an action is performed, or *czym*. It is always used with a preposition (most commonly **s** - with) or after certain verbs, including the verb **być** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state.

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-ym** (hard) / **-iym** (soft). (e.g., s braciorz**ym** - with a brother, s utytel**ym** - with a teacher, s miast**ym** - with a city, s pol**ym** - with a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-ům** (hard) / **-iům** (soft). (e.g., z siostrz**ům** - with a sister, z ziymi**ům** - with land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* ending **-ami**. (e.g., z bratami - with brothers, z utytelami - with teachers, z siostrami - with sisters, z miastami - with cities)
* **Adjectives:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-ym** (hard) / **-iym** (soft). (e.g., z dobrym braciorzym - with a good brother, z inš**ym** utytel**ym** - with a different teacher)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-ům** (hard) / **-iům** (soft). (e.g., z dobrům siostrzům - with a good sister, z inš**iům** ziymi**ům** - with different land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* ending **-ymi**. (e.g., z dobrymi bratami - with good brothers, z inš**ymi** utytelami - with different teachers)
* *Examples:* Idym **s kamratym** (I am going with a friend). Łoni gŏdajům **s nami** (They are talking with us). Pisza **uůwkym** (I am writing with a pencil). Łona je **dobrům študyntkům** (She is a good student). My żeśmy sům **dobrymi študyntami** (We are good students).

# Hobbies (Verbs – Imperfective only)

## Verb Conjugations (Present Tense - Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, Silesian verbs follow various conjugation patterns.

* **-ać conjugation:** Includes verbs like **czytać** (to read), **robić** (to do). Endings: -**am**, -**asz**, -**a**, -**amy**, -**ocie**, -**ajům**.
    * *Example: czytać* -> Jo czyt**am** (I read/am reading), Ty czyt**osz** (You read/are reading), Łon/Łona/Łono czyt**o** (He/She/It reads/is reading), My czyt**omy** (We read/am reading), Wy czyt**ocie** (You read/are reading), Łoni/Łone czyt**ajům** (They read/are reading).

# Sports (very basic accusative case + very basic locative)

## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's begin with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Miejscownik) is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **we** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widza **stół** - I see a table, Widza **pole** - I see a field)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widza **ôjca** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* End in **-a** (hard) / **-io** (soft). (e.g., Widza **babã** - I see a woman, Widza **ziymiã** - I see land)
* **Locative (Miejscownik) with 'na/we' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stole** - on a table, we **polu** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Often end in **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., na **rzyce** - on a river, na **ziymi** - on land)
* *Examples:* Czytóm **ksiůnżka** (I am reading a book - Accusative feminine ending). Siedzymy **na stole** (We are sitting on a table).

# Food (Accusative case)

## The Proper Accusative Case: The Direct Object

The **Accusative case** is the case of the direct object, indicating the person or thing directly affected by the verb's action (e.g., "I see *him*", "She reads *a book*"). Its forms depend on gender, number, and whether a masculine noun is animate (living) or inanimate (non-living).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative (consonant/-o/-e/-y/-i). (e.g., Widza **stół** - I see a table, Widza **pole** - I see a field, Widza **ôkno** - I see a window)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widza **ôjca** - I see a father, Widza **chopa** - I see a man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-a** (hard) / **-io** (soft). (e.g., Widza **ksiůnżka** - I see a book, Widza **ziymiã** - I see land)
    * *Plural Masculine Inanimate/Feminine/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural (-y/-i/-a). (e.g., Widza **stoły** - I see tables, Widza **ksiůnżki** - I see books, Widza **ôkna** - I see windows)

* **Adjectives:** Follow the rules of the noun they modify. Hard stem adjectives use hard endings, soft stem adjectives use soft endings.
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Singular (hard -y/-e, soft -i/-e). (e.g., Widza **stary** dom - I see an old house, Widza **inše** pole - I see a different field)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Singular (hard **-ego**, soft **-igo**). (e.g., Widza **starego** ôjca - I see an old father, Widza **inšigo** chopa - I see a different man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-a** (hard) / **-io** (soft). (e.g., Widza **nowa** ksiůnżk**a** - I see a new book, Widza **inš**o ziymi**ã** - I see different land)
    * *Plural Masculine Inanimate/Feminine/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural (hard -e/-e, soft -e/-e). (e.g., Widza **stare** domy - I see old houses, Widza **inše** ksiůnżki - I see different books)
    * *Plural Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Plural (hard **-ych**, soft **-ich**). (e.g., Widza **starych** ôjcōw - I see old fathers, Widza **inšich** chopōw - I see different men)

# Drinks (Genitive case)

## The Genitive Case: Possession, Absence, and More

The **Genitive case** indicates possession (like 'of' or 's), absence (with **bez** - without), origin (with **z** - from), or location at/having ('at' or 'have' with **u**). Its primary role is showing belonging or relation, or being required by certain prepositions.

* **Nouns:** Endings vary based on gender, number, and hard/soft stem.
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* hard/soft **-a**. (e.g., dom brat**a** - brother's house, ksiůnżka utytel**a** - teacher's book, ôkno pola - field window)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-y** or **-i**, soft **-i**. (e.g., ksiůnżka siostr**y** - sister's book, głos ziymi**e** - voice of the land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* Varies, often **-ōw** (masculine and some others) or a **zero ending** (feminine, neuter, some masc). (e.g., domy brat**ōw** - brothers' houses, ksiůnżki utytel**i** - teachers' books, ksiůnżki bab**∅** - women's books, ôkna pol**∅** - field windows)
* **Adjectives:**

Łoni jadům **bez wody** (They are going without water). Widzioł żech mocka **piynknych bab** (I saw many beautiful women).

# Studying & Writing (Locative case)

## The Proper Locative Case: Location and Topic

The **Locative case** (Miejscownik) specifies location ('in', 'on', 'at') or the topic of discussion ('about'). It is unique because it is *always* used with a preposition, such as **we** (in), **na** (on), or **ô** (about).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* For all **-u**. (e.g., we dom**u** - in a house, ô chop**ie** - about a man, we polu - in a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* Common endings include **-e** or **-i**. (e.g., na rzyc**e** - on a river, ô siostr**ze** - about a sister, na ziymi**i** - on land)
    * *Plural (all genders):* Often ends in **-ach**. (e.g., we dom**ach** - in houses, ô chop**ach** - about men, we pol**ach** - in fields)
* **Adjectives:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-ym**, soft **-iym**. (e.g., we dobrym domu - in a good house, ô inš**ym** chop**ie** - about a different man)

# Animals (Dative case)

## The Dative Case: To Whom? For Whom?

The **Dative case** is used to show the indirect object of a verb – **kōmu** or **dla kogo** an action is done. It's also used after certain verbs and prepositions. Its main purpose is to indicate the recipient of something or the beneficiary of an action.

* **Nouns:** Endings change based on gender, number, and hard/soft stem.
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* **-u**. (e.g., brat**u** - to a brother, dóm utytel**owi** - I give to a teacher, pol**u** - to a field).

* *Examples:* Dej ksiůnżka **brat**u** (Give the book to the brother). Gŏdóm **študynt**ōm** (I am speaking to the students). Idym **do siostr**y** (I am going to the sister - Dative not used with 'do'). Pisza list **starzyk**ōm** (I am writing a letter to the parents).

# Numbers 0-10

## The numbers from 0 to 10 are these:
* 0 nul

* 5 pjyńć
* 6 sześ
* 7 siedym
* 8 ôziym
* 9 dźewjyńć
* 10 dźesiyńć

*Grammar note:* The case of the noun following the numbers changes. For 1, it's Nominative singular. For 2, 3, and 4, it's Nominative plural. For 0 and numbers from 5 upwards, it's Genitive plural.

* *Examples:* trzi domy (Nominative plural) - three houses, nul dom**ōw** (Genitive plural) - zero houses, jeden dom (Nominative singular) - one house, dwa domy (Nominative plural) - two houses, pjyńć dom**ōw** (Genitive plural) - five houses.

# Numbers 11-20

## The numbers from 10 to 20 are these:
* 10 dźesiyńć
* 11 jedynost
* 12 dwunost
* 13 trzinost
* 14 sztyrnost
* 15 pjyńćnost
* 16 sześnost
* 17 siedymnost
* 18 ôziymnost
* 19 dźewjyńćnost
* 20 dwadzieścia

These numbers always require the Genitive plural case for the following noun.

* *Example:* siedymnost dom**ōw** (Genitive plural) - seventeen houses.

# Numbers 10-100

## The numbers from 10 to 100 are these:
* 10 dźesiyńć
* 20 dwadzieścia
* 30 trzidzieści
* 40 sztyrdzieści
* 50 pjyńćdziesiůnt
* 60 sześdziesiůnt
* 70 siedymdziesiůnt
* 80 ôziymdziesiůnt
* 90 dźewjyńćdziesiůnt
* 100 sto

The case of the following noun depends on the last digit of the number (except for 11-19, which always take Genitive plural).

* *Examples:* 83 psy (Nominative plural) - eighty-three dogs (governed by 'trzi'), 41 ps**ōw** (Genitive plural) - forty-one dogs (governed by 'jeden').

# Numbers 100-1000

## The numbers from 100 to 1000 are these:
* 100 sto
* 200 dwieścia
* 300 trzysta
* 400 sztyrysta
* 500 pjyńćset

* 900 dźewjyńćset
* 1000 tyśōnc

The case of the following noun depends on the last two digits (or last digit if it's 1, 2, 3, or 4 not preceded by 1).

* *Example:* 1232 psy (Nominative plural) - one thousand two hundred thirty-two dogs (governed by 'dwa').

# Ordinal Numbers

## The ordinal numbers from 1 to 1000 are these:
* 1 piyrszy
* 2 drugi
* 3 trzeći
* 4 sztworty
* 5 pjůnty
* 6 szůsty
* 7 siůdmy
* 8 ôsmy
* 9 dźewiůnty
* 100 stny
* 1000 tyśynczny

Like in the Interslavic explanation, these function grammatically like adjectives and decline accordingly.

To state the time of day, you typically use the preposition **ô** followed by the ordinal number in the Locative case and the word **godźinie** (Locative case of "godźina").

* *Example:* 8:45 -> ô ôsm**ej** godźinie sztyrdzieści pjůńć - at eight forty-five.

# Talking about Time (past tense)

## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense. This is formed using the past participle of the verb, which ends in **-ł** (for masculine singular), **-ła** (for feminine singular), **-ło** (for neuter singular), or **-li** (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding past tense form of the verb **być** is generally omitted in modern Silesian.

* Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    * Masculine Singular: -**ł** (e.g., Łon czyto**ł**) (He read)
    * Feminine Singular: -**ła** (e.g., Łona czyto**ła**) (She read)
    * Neuter Singular: -**ło** (e.g., Łono czyto**ło**) (It read)
    * Plural (all genders): -**li** (e.g., Łoni czyto**li**) (They read)

* *Examples:* Wczora **jo żech robioł** (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Wczora łona **robioła** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My **żeśmy widzieli** film (We saw a film). Łoni **przijechali** zôś (They arrived again).

# Seasons of the year (future tense)

## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining a future form of the verb **być** ('to be') with the infinitive (the base form, ending in **-ć**) of the main verb.

* Future forms of 'być': **byda, bydziesz, byńdzie, bydymy, byńdziecie, byndům**
* *Formation:* Future 'być' form + Infinitive of main verb

* *Examples:* Jo **byda czytać** ksiůnżka (I will read a book). Ty **bydziesz godać** s nim (You will talk with him). Łona **byńdzie robić** jutro (She will work tomorrow). My **bydymy pisać** (We will write). Łoni **byndům dziwać sie** na film (They will watch a film).

# Clothes  (basic conjunctions)

## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'a', 'abo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **i:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jo **i** ty - I and you. Czytóm **i** pisza - I read and write.)
* **a:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Łon je utytelem, **a** łona je študyntkům - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jo ida, **a** ty zostajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **abo:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa **abo** tukej? - Coffee or here? Przijedziecie **abo** zostaniecie doma? - Will you come or stay at home?)

# Character (Conditional)

## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the **-ł/-ła/-ło/-li** form) followed by the conditional particle **by**. The particle **by** is usually placed after the verb or the subject.

* *Formation:* Past tense (l-form) + particle **by**

* *Examples:* Jo **czytoł by** (m.) / **czytoła by** (f.) ta ksiůnżka (I would read that book). Łon **poszoł by** do kina (He would go to the cinema). My **robili by** to wszyjsko razym (We would do that all together). Co **byście chciele**? (What would you like? - using the past tense plural form for 'wy').

# Emotions (adverbs)

## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o** or **-e**.

* *Examples:* dobrze (well, from dobry - good), wartko (quickly, from wartki - quick), cicho (quietly, from cichy - quiet), daleko (far).
* *In sentences:* Łon gŏdo **dobrze** (He speaks well). Łona bioego **wartko** (She runs quickly). Miyszkōmy **daleko** (We live far away).

# Physical Appearance (Easy comparisons)

## Easy Comparisons: Wyży and Niż

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than' or 'taller/higher than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'lepij' - better, 'wiyncy' - more) followed by the word **niż** (than). The word **wyży** is the comparative form of wysoki (tall/high) and means 'higher' or 'taller'.

* *Using niż:* Moja ksiůnżka je ciekawszo **niż** twoja (My book is more interesting than yours). Łon je starszy **niż** jo (He is older than me).
* *Using wyży:* Ta góra je **wyży** niż tyn kopec (That mountain is higher than that hill). Łon skoczył **wyży** niż norma (He jumped higher than the norm).
