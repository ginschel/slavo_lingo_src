# Conjugation of to be

## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Old Church Slavonic language. OCS is an older stage of Slavic and has more complex features than modern Slavic languages, so understanding its structure is key.

## Conjugation of 'byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (**быти**) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. OCS has singular, dual (for two), and plural forms.

* **Singular:**
    * Азъ **ѥсмъ** (I am)
    * Тꙑ **ѥси** (You are)
    * Онъ/Она/Оно **ѥстъ** (He/She/It is)
* **Dual:**
    * Вѣ **ѥсвѣ** (We two are)
    * Въі **ѥста** (You two are)
    * Онѣ/Она **ѥстѣ** (They two are - masc/neuter / They two are - fem)
* **Plural:**
    * Мꙑ **ѥсмъ** (We are)
    * Вꙑ **ѥсте** (You are)
    * Они/Она **сѫтъ** (They are - masc/neuter / They are - fem)

* *Examples:* Азъ **ѥсмъ** рабъ (I am a servant). Она́ **ѥстъ** добра́ (She is good). Мꙑ **ѥсмъ** добри раби (We are good servants). Они́ **сѫтъ** сьде (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Old Church Slavonic nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun, as well as noun declension patterns. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

* **Masculine:** Most nouns ending in a hard or soft consonant are masculine (e.g., **домъ** - house, **столъ** - table, **отьць** - father, **мѫжь** - man).
* **Feminine:** Most nouns ending in -**а** or -**ꙗ** (after a soft consonant or vowel) are feminine (e.g., **жена́** - woman, **книга** - book, **землꙗ́** - earth/land). Some nouns ending in a consonant are feminine (e.g., **нощь** - night).
* **Neuter:** Most nouns ending in -**о** or -**е** are neuter (e.g., **село́** - village, **мо́ре** - sea).

* *Keep in mind:* There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with consonant-ending feminine nouns, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The **Nominative case** is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

* **Nouns:** Singular, dual, and plural forms vary based on gender and declension class.
    * *Hard Masculine Examples:* Sg: **домъ**. Du: **дома**. Pl: **доми**.
    * *Soft Masculine Examples:* Sg: **мѫжь**. Du: **мѫжа**. Pl: **мѫжи**.
    * *Feminine Examples:* Sg: **жена́**. Du: **женѣ**. Pl: **жены**. Sg: **нощь**. Du: **нощи**. Pl: **нощи**.
    * *Neuter Examples:* Sg: **село́**. Du: **селѣ**. Pl: **села́**.
* **Adjectives:** Agree in gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and case with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard (ь-stem) and soft (j-stem) stems, and also distinguish between definite and indefinite forms (which is a complex topic on its own). Here we show the simple/indefinite forms in the nominative.
    * *Hard Stem Examples:* Sg: **добръ** (m), **добра** (f), **добро** (n). Du: **добра** (m/n), **добрѣ** (f). Pl: **добри** (m), **добры** (f), **добра** (n).
    * *Soft Stem Examples:* Sg: **синь** (m), **синя** (f), **синѥ** (n). Du: **синя** (m/n), **сини** (f). Pl: **сини** (m), **синя** (f/n).
* *Examples:* **Добръ домъ** ѥстъ старъ (A good house is old). **Синѥ мо́ре** ѥстъ велико (The blue sea is big). **Краснꙑ** жєнꙑ́ говоратъ (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that." In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number (singular, dual, plural) of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

* **Singular:** **сь** (m), **сьꙗ** (f), **си** (n) - (this) / **онъ** (m), **она́** (f), **оно́** (n) - (that - referring to something already mentioned)
* **Dual:** **сꙗ** (m/n), **си** (f) - (these two) / **она́** (m/n), **онѣ** (f) - (those two)
* **Plural:** **си** (m), **сꙙ** (f/n) - (these) / **они́** (m), **она́** (f/n) - (those)

* *Examples:* **Сь** домъ ѥстъ великъ (This house is big). **Сьꙗ** книга ѥстъ моꙗ́ (This book is mine). **Си** село́ ѥстъ наше (This village is ours). **Си** людиѥ сѫтъ весели (These people are cheerful).

## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily indicates *s kimъ* or *čimъ* an action is performed, or *čimъ*. It is always used with a preposition (most commonly **съ** - with) or after certain verbs, including the verb **быти** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state. OCS has singular, dual, and plural forms for the Instrumental case.

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-omъ**, soft **-emъ**. (e.g., съ брат**омъ** - with a brother, съ отьц**емъ** - with a father, съ сел**омъ** - with a village, съ пол**емъ** - with a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-ojǫ**, soft **-ejǫ**. (e.g., съ сестр**ою** - with a sister, съ земл**ею** - with land)
    * *Dual (all genders):* hard/soft **-ama**. (e.g., съ брат**ама** - with two brothers, съ сестр**ама** - with two sisters)
    * *Plural (all genders):* hard/soft **-ꙑ**: (e.g., съ брат**ы** - with brothers, съ отьц**и** - with fathers, съ сестр**ами** - with sisters, съ сел**ы** - with villages)
* **Adjectives (Simple/Indefinite):**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-ymъ**, soft **-imъ**. (e.g., съ добр**ымъ** бра́т**омъ** - with a good brother, съ син**имъ** мор**емъ** - with the blue sea)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-ojǫ**, soft **-ejǫ**. (e.g., съ добр**ою** сестр**ою** - with a good sister, съ си́н**ею** земл**ею** - with the blue land)

## Verb Conjugations (Present Tense - Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, Old Church Slavonic verbs follow several conjugation patterns based on their stem and infinitive ending. OCS has singular, dual, and plural forms in the present tense.

* **-a- stem conjugation:** Includes verbs like **чита́ти** (to read), **дѣ́лати** (to do).
    * *Example: чита́ти* -> Sg: Я чита́ѭ (I read/am reading), Тꙑ чита́ѥши, Онъ чита́ѥтъ. Du: Вѣ чита́ѥвѣ, Въі чита́ѥта, Онѣ чита́ѥтѣ. Pl: Мꙑ чита́ѥмъ, Вꙑ чита́ѥте, Они́ чита́ѭтъ.
* **-e- stem conjugation:** Includes verbs like **имѣ́ти** (to have).
    * *Example: имѣ́ти* -> Sg: Я имѣ́ѭ, Тꙑ имѣ́ѥши, Онъ имѣ́ѥтъ. Du: Вѣ имѣ́ѥвѣ, Въі имѣ́ѥта, Онѣ имѣ́ѥтѣ. Pl: Мꙑ имѣ́ѥмъ, Вꙑ имѣ́ѥте, Они́ имѣ́ѭтъ.
* **-i- stem conjugation:** Includes verbs like **говори́ти** (to speak).
    * *Example: говори́ти* -> Sg: Я говорі́ѭ, Тꙑ говорі́ши, Онъ говорі́тъ. Du: Вѣ говорі́вѣ, Въі говорі́та, Онѣ говорі́тѣ. Pl: Мꙑ говорі́мъ, Вꙑ говорі́те, Они́ говорꙗ́тъ.

## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (кого or что receives the action). The **Locative case** (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like **на** (on) or **въ** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Вижджѫ̀ **домъ** - I see a house, Вижджѫ̀ **село́** - I see a village)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Вижджѫ̀ **отьцꙗ́** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* hard **-ѫ**, soft **-ѭ**. (e.g., Вижджѫ̀ **женѫ́** - I see a woman, Вижджѫ̀ **землю́** - I see land)
* **Locative (Prepositional) with 'на/въ' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* hard **-ѣ**, soft **-и** or **-и**. (e.g., на **столѣ́** - on a table, въ **селѣ́** - in a village, на **поли** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* hard **-ѣ**, soft **-и**. (e.g., на **рѣцѣ́** - on a river, въ **земли́** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Чи́тамъ **книгѫ́** (I am reading a book). Сѣди́мъ **на столѣ́** (We are sitting on a table).

## The Proper Accusative Case: The Direct Object

The **Accusative case** is the case of the direct object, indicating the person or thing directly affected by the verb's action (e.g., "I see *him*", "She reads *a book*"). Its forms depend on gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and whether a masculine noun is animate (living) or inanimate (non-living).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative. (e.g., Вижджѫ̀ **домъ** - I see a house, Вижджѫ̀ **село́** - I see a village)

Old Church Slavonic has several past tenses, including the Aorist and the Imperfect. These describe completed actions (Aorist) or ongoing/repeated actions (Imperfect) in the past.

* **Aorist:** Formed by adding specific endings directly to the verb stem. Endings vary based on verb class and person/number (singular, dual, plural).
    * *Example: пасти́ (to fall)* -> Sg: Азъ па́схъ, Тꙑ па́се, Онъ па́се. Du: Вѣ па́совѣ, Въі па́ста, Онѣ па́стѣ. Pl: Мꙑ па́сомъ, Вꙑ па́сте, Они́ па́сѫ.
* **Imperfect:** Formed by adding specific endings to the verb stem, often including -ѣа- or -аа-. Endings vary based on verb class and person/number.
    * *Example: нес**ѣа**хъ (I was carrying)* -> Sg: Азъ нес**ѣа**хъ, Тꙑ нес**ѣа**ше, Онъ нес**ѣа**ше. Du: Вѣ нес**ѣа**ховѣ, Въі нес**ѣа**шета, Онѣ нес**ѣа**шетѣ. Pl: Мꙑ нес**ѣа**хомъ, Вꙑ нес**ѣа**шете, Они́ нес**ѣа**хѫ.

* *Examples (Aorist):* Вчера́ **па́се** сьнѣгъ (Yesterday snow fell). Мꙑ **видѣхомъ** фильмъ (We saw a film).
* *Examples (Imperfect):* Вчера́ **рабо́таахъ** (masc.) (Yesterday I was working). Вчера́ она́ **рабо́тааше** (fem.) (Yesterday she was working).

## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you can combine the future tense of **быти** ('to be') with the infinitive of the main verb, or use the simple future for perfective verbs.

* Compound Future ('Быти' + Infinitive - for imperfective verbs): Future forms of **быти** (бу́дѫ, бу́деши, бу́детъ, бу́девѣ, бу́дета, бу́детѣ, бу́демъ, бу́дете, бу́дѫтъ) + Infinitive.
* Simple Future (for perfective verbs): Formed using the present tense conjugation of the perfective verb.

* *Examples (Compound Future - imperfective):* Азъ **бу́дѫ чита́ти** книгѫ́ (I will read a book). Тꙑ **бу́деши говори́ти** съ ни́мь (You will speak with him). Она́ **бу́детъ рабо́тати** оутрѣ (She will work tomorrow). Мꙑ **бу́демъ писа́ти** (We will write). Они́ **бу́дѫтъ зьрѣти** фильмъ (They will watch a film).
* *Examples (Simple Future - perfective):* Азъ **прочита́ѭ** книгѫ́ (I will read a book). Тꙑ **рекꙁе́ши** ѥмоу́ (You will tell him). Она́ **сътвори́тъ** сиѥ (She will do this).

## Using Conjunctions: 'и', 'а', 'или'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **и:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Азъ **и** тꙑ - I and you. Чи́тамъ **и** пишѫ́ - I read and write.)
* **а:** Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Онъ ѥстъ оучи́тель, **а** она́ ѥстъ оучени́ца - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Азъ идѫ́, **а** тꙑ оста́ѥши сѧ - I am going, and you are staying.)
* **или:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Ка́ва **или** ча́и? - Coffee or tea? Придѣ́те **или** оста́нете сѧ дома́? - Will you come or stay at home?)

## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the aorist forms of the verb **быти** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли** form).

* Aorist forms of 'быти': **бы́хъ, бы́, бы́, бы́ховѣ, бы́ста, бы́стѣ, бы́хомъ, бы́сте, бы́шѧ**
* Formation: Aorist of 'быти' + Past active participle (-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли)

* *Examples:* Азъ **бы́хъ чи́талъ** (masc.) / **бы́хъ чи́тала** (fem.) тоу книгѫ́ (I would read that book). Онъ **бы́ ѥдинъ шьлъ** въ кино́ (He would go to the cinema alone). Мꙑ **бы́хомъ сътвори́ли** сиѥ все вьсе́ѭ (We would do all this together). Чьто́ **бы́сте хотѣ́ли**? (What would you like?).

## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-о** or **-е**.

* *Examples:* до́брѣ (well, from добръ - good), бы́стро (quickly, from бы́стръ - quick), ти́хо (quietly, from ти́хъ - quiet), дале́че (far).
* *In sentences:* Онъ гово́ритъ **до́брѣ** (He speaks well). Она́ бѣ́гаѥтъ **бы́стро** (She runs quickly). Живе́мъ **дале́че** (We live far away).

## Easy Comparisons: Въіше and Nеже/Отъ

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than' or 'taller/higher than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'лѣ́пшии' - better, 'бо́лии' - bigger) followed by the word **неже** or **отъ** (than). The word **въіше** is the comparative adverb of высо́къ (tall/high) and means 'higher' or 'taller'.

* *Using неже:* Моꙗ́ книга ѥстъ ціка́вѣиши **неже** твоꙗ́ (My book is more interesting than yours). Онъ ѥстъ ста́рѣиши **неже** азъ (He is older than me).
* *Using отъ:* Моꙗ́ книга ѥстъ ціка́вѣиши **отъ** твоѥѩ́ (My book is more interesting than yours). Онъ ѥстъ ста́рѣиши **отъ** мене́ (He is older than me).
* *Using въіше:* Та гора́ ѥстъ **въіше**, неже тъ хълмъ (That mountain is higher than that hill). Онъ скочи́ **въіше** за но́рмѫ (He jumped higher than the norm).
