# Conjugation of to be

## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Slovenian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'biti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (**biti**) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. Slovenian has singular, dual (for two), and plural forms.

* **Singular:**
    * Jaz **sem** (I am)
    * Ti **si** (You are, singular informal)
    * On/Ona/Ono **je** (He/She/It is)
* **Dual:**
    * Midva/Midve **sva** (We two are)
    * Vidva/Vidve **sta** (You two are)
    * Onadva/Onidve/Oni **sta** (They two are - masc/neuter / They two are - fem)
* **Plural:**
    * Mi **smo** (We are)
    * Vi **ste** (You are)
    * Oni/One **so** (They are)

* *Examples:* Jaz **sem** študent (I am a student). Moja sestra **je** dobra (My sister is good). Midva **sva** dobra prijatelja (We two are good friends). Oni **so** tukaj (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Slovenian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

* **Masculine:** Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., **dom** - house, **stol** - table, **učitelj** - teacher).
* **Feminine:** Most nouns ending in -**a** are feminine (e.g., **žena** - woman, **knjiga** - book, **zemlja** - earth/land).
* **Neuter:** Most nouns ending in -**o** or -**e** are neuter (e.g., **mesto** - city, **morje** - sea).

* *Keep in mind:* There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The **Nominative case** is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

* **Nouns:** Singular, dual, and plural forms vary based on gender.
    * *Masculine Examples:* Sg: **dom**. Du: **doma**. Pl: **domovi**.
    * *Feminine Examples:* Sg: **žena**. Du: **ženi**. Pl: **žene**.
    * *Neuter Examples:* Sg: **mesto**. Du: **mesti**. Pl: **mesta**.
* **Adjectives:** Agree in gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and case with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    * *Hard Stem Examples:* Singular: **dober** (m), **dobra** (f), **dobro** (n). Dual: **dobra** (m/n), **dobri** (f). Plural: **dobri** (m), **dobre** (f/n).
    * *Soft Stem Examples:* Singular: **svež** (m), **sveža** (f), **sveže** (n). Dual: **sveža** (m/n), **sveži** (f). Plural: **sveži** (m), **sveže** (f/n).
* *Examples:* **Dober dom** je star (A good house is old). **Sveža polja** so zelena (Fresh fields are green). **Lepe ženske** govorijo (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number (singular, dual, plural) of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

* **Singular:** **ta** (m), **ta** (f), **to** (n) - (this/that)
* **Dual:** **ta** (m), **ti** (f), **ti** (n) - (these/those two)
* **Plural:** **ti** (m), **te** (f), **ta** (n) - (these/those)

* *Examples:* **Ta** dom je velik (This/That house is big). **Ta** knjiga je moja (This/That book is mine). **To** je naše mesto (This/That is our city). **Ti** ljudje so veseli (These/Those people are cheerful).

## The Instrumental Case: With and By Means Of

The **Instrumental case** primarily indicates *s kom* or *čim* an action is performed, or *čim*. It is always used with a preposition (most commonly **s/s/z/ze** - with) or after certain verbs, including the verb **biti** (to be) when describing someone's profession or state. Slovenian has singular, dual, and plural forms for the Instrumental case.

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-om**. (e.g., s bratom - with a brother, z učitelj**em** - with a teacher, z mest**om** - with a city, s polj**em** - with a field)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-o**. (e.g., s sestr**o** - with a sister, z zemljo - with land)
    * *Dual (all genders):* ending **-oma**. (e.g., z brat**oma** - with two brothers, s sestr**ama** - with two sisters)
    * *Plural (all genders):* ending **-i**. (e.g., z brat**i** - with brothers, z učitelj**i** - with teachers, s sestrami - with sisters, z mest**i** - with cities)
* **Adjectives:**
    * *Singular Masculine/Neuter:* ending **-im**. (e.g., z dobr**im** bratom - with a good brother, s svež**im** zrak**om** - with fresh air)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-o**. (e.g., z dobr**o** sestr**o** - with a good sister, s svež**o** vodo - with fresh water)
    * *Dual (all genders):* ending **-ima**. (e.g., z dobr**ima** brat**oma** - with two good brothers, s svež**ima** oč**ema** - with two fresh eyes)
    * *Plural (all genders):* ending **-imi**. (e.g., z dobr**imi** brat**i** - with good brothers, s svež**imi** zrak**i** - with fresh air)
* *Examples:* Grem **s prijateljem** (I am going with a friend). Oni govorijo **z nami** (They are talking with us). Pišem **s svinčnikom** (I am writing with a pencil). Ona je **dobro študentko** (She is a good student - Instrumental used for state/profession). Midva sva **dobrima študentoma** (We two are good students).

## Verb Conjugations (Present Tense - Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, Slovenian verbs follow several conjugation patterns based on their stem and infinitive ending. Slovenian has singular, dual, and plural forms in the present tense.

* **-am conjugation:** Includes verbs like **brati** (to read), **delati** (to do).
    * *Example: brati* -> Sg: Jaz ber**em** (I read/am reading), Ti ber**eš**, On/Ona/Ono ber**e**. Du: Midva/Midve ber**eva**, Vidva/Vidve ber**eta**, Onadva/Onidve/Oni ber**eta**. Pl: Mi ber**emo**, Vi ber**ete**, Oni/One ber**ejo**.
* **-im conjugation:** Includes verbs like **govoriti** (to speak), **videti** (to see).
    * *Example: govoriti* -> Sg: Jaz govor**im** (I speak/am speaking), Ti govor**iš**, On/Ona/Ono govor**i**. Du: Midva/Midve govor**iva**, Vidva/Vidve govor**ita**, Onadva/Onidve/Oni govor**ita**. Pl: Mi govor**imo**, Vi govor**ite**, Oni/One govor**ijo**.

## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The **Accusative case** often marks the direct object (koga or kaj receives the action). The **Locative case** is used for location after prepositions like **na** (on) or **v** (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

* **Accusative (Singular):**
    * *Masculine Inanimate & Neuter:* Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidim **grad** - I see a castle, Vidim **mesto** - I see a city)
    * *Masculine Animate:* Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim **očeta** - I see a father)
    * *Feminine:* Ending **-o**. (e.g., Vidim **žensko** - I see a woman, Vidim **knjigo** - I see a book)
* **Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):**
    * *Masculine/Neuter:* Ends in **-u**. (e.g., na **stolu** - on a table, v **mestu** - in a city, na **polju** - in a field)
    * *Feminine:* Ends in **-i**. (e.g., na **reki** - on a river, v **zemlji** - in the earth)
* *Examples:* Berem **knjigo** (I am reading a book). Sedim **na stolu** (I am sitting on a table).

## The Proper Accusative Case: The Direct Object

The **Accusative case** is the case of the direct object, indicating the person or thing directly affected by the verb's action (e.g., "I see *him*", "She reads *a book*"). Its forms depend on gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and whether a masculine noun is animate (living) or inanimate (non-living).

* **Nouns:**
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative. (e.g., Vidim **dom** - I see a house, Vidim **mesto** - I see a city)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim **očeta** - I see a father, Vidim **moža** - I see a man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* ending **-o**. (e.g., Vidim **knjigo** - I see a book, Vidim **zemljo** - I see land)
    * *Dual (all genders):* Same as Nominative Dual. (e.g., Vidim **dva doma** - I see two houses, Vidim **dve ženski** - I see two women, Vidim **dve mesti** - I see two cities)
    * *Plural Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Plural. (e.g., Vidim **domove** - I see houses, Vidim **mesta** - I see cities)

    * *Plural Feminine:* Same as Nominative Plural (-e). (e.g., Vidim **ženske** - I see women, Vidim **knjige** - I see books)
* **Adjectives:** Follow the rules of the noun they modify. Hard stem adjectives use hard endings, soft stem adjectives use soft endings.
    * *Singular Masculine Inanimate/Neuter:* Same as Nominative Sg (hard -er/-a/-o, soft -ž/-a/-e). (e.g., Vidim **star** dom - I see an old house, Vidim **sveže** sadje - I see fresh fruit)
    * *Singular Masculine Animate:* Same as Genitive Sg (hard **-ega**, soft **-ega**). (e.g., Vidim **starega** očeta - I see an old father, Vidim **svežega** moškega - I see a fresh man)
    * *Singular Feminine:* hard **-o**, soft **-o**. (e.g., Vidim **novo** knjig**o** - I see a new book, Vidim **svežo** vod**o** - I see fresh water)

# Numbers 0-10

## The numbers from 0 to 10 are these:
* 0 nič
* 1 ena (f), en (m), eno (n)

* 5 pet
* 6 šest
* 7 sedem
* 8 osem
* 9 devet
* 10 deset

*Grammar note:* The case of the noun following the numbers changes. For 1, it's Nominative singular. For 2, 3, and 4, it's Nominative or Accusative dual or plural depending on gender and case. For numbers from 5 upwards, it's Genitive plural.

* *Examples:* trije domovi (Nominative plural) - three houses, nič hiš (Genitive plural) - zero houses, en dom (Nominative singular) - one house, dva doma (Nominative dual) - two houses, pet hiš (Genitive plural) - five houses.

# Numbers 11-20

## The numbers from 10 to 20 are these:
* 10 deset
* 11 enajst
* 12 dvanajst
* 13 trinajst
* 14 štirinajst
* 15 petnajst
* 16 šestnajst
* 17 sedemnajst
* 18 osemnajst
* 19 devetnajst
* 20 dvajset

These numbers always require the Genitive plural case for the following noun.

* *Example:* sedemnajst hiš (Genitive plural) - seventeen houses.

# Numbers 10-100

## The numbers from 10 to 100 are these:
* 10 deset
* 20 dvajset
* 30 trideset
* 40 štirideset
* 50 petdeset
* 60 šestdeset
* 70 sedemdeset
* 80 osemdeset
* 90 devetdeset
* 100 sto

The case of the following noun depends on the last digit of the number (except for 11-19, which always take Genitive plural).

* *Examples:* 83 psi (Nominative plural) - eighty-three dogs (governed by 'trije'), 41 psov (Genitive plural) - forty-one dogs (governed by 'en').

# Numbers 100-1000

## The numbers from 100 to 1000 are these:
* 100 sto
* 200 dvesto
* 300 tristo
* 400 štiristo
* 500 petsto
* 600 šeststo
* 700 sedemsto

* 900 devetsto
* 1000 tisoč

The case of the following noun depends on the last two digits (or last digit if it's 1, 2, 3, or 4 not preceded by 1).

* *Example:* 1232 psi (Nominative plural) - one thousand two hundred thirty-two dogs (governed by 'dva').

# Ordinal Numbers

## The ordinal numbers from 1 to 1000 are these:
* 1 prvi

* 4 četrti
* 5 peti
* 6 šesti
* 7 sedmi
* 8 osmi
* 9 deveti
* 100 stoti
* 1000 tisoči

Like in the Interslavic explanation, these function grammatically like adjectives and decline accordingly.

To state the time of day, you typically use the preposition **ob** followed by the ordinal number in the Locative case and the word **uri**.

* *Example:* ob osm**ih** uri petinštirideset minut - at eight forty-five.

# Talking about Time

## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense. This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in **-l** (for masculine singular), **-la** (for feminine singular), **-lo** (for neuter singular), **-la** (for dual masculine), **-li** (for dual feminine/neuter), or **-li** (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding present tense form of the verb **biti** is used for all persons *except* the third person singular and plural, where it is often omitted.

* Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    * Masculine Singular: -**l** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - On bral (He read)
    * Feminine Singular: -**la** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Ona bra**la** (She read)
    * Neuter Singular: -**lo** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Ono bra**lo** (It read)
    * Dual Masculine: -**la** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Midva bra**la** (We two read)
    * Dual Feminine/Neuter: -**li** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Midve bra**li**, Mesti bra**li** (We two read, Two cities read)
    * Plural (all genders): -**li** (followed by appropriate form of *biti*) - Mi bra**li**, Oni bra**li** (We read, They read)

* *Examples:* Včeraj **sem delal** (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Včeraj ona **je delala** (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). Midva **sva videla** film (We two saw a film). Oni **so prišli** pozno (They arrived late).

# Seasons of the year

## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining the future tense of the verb **biti** ('to be') with the past active participle of the main verb. For perfective verbs, you use the simple future tense form (one word).

* Compound Future ('biti' + Past Active Participle - for imperfective verbs): bom, boš, bo, bova/bosta/bosta, bomo, boste, bodo + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)
* Simple Future (for perfective verbs): Formed using the present tense stem of the perfective verb.

* *Examples (Compound Future - imperfective):* Jaz **bom bral** knjigo (I will read a book). Ti **boš govoril** z njim (You will talk with him). Ona **bo delala** jutri (She will work tomorrow). Midva **bova pisala** (We two will write). Oni **bodo gledali** film (They will watch a film).
* *Examples (Simple Future - perfective):* Jaz **preberem** knjigo (I will read a book). Ti **poveš** mu (You will tell him). Ona **naredi** to (She will do it).

## Using Conjunctions: 'in', 'ali', 'pa'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

* **in:** Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jaz **in** ti - I and you. Berem **in** pišem - I read and write.)
* **ali:** Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava **ali** čaj? - Coffee or tea? Boste prišli **ali** ostali doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
* **pa:** Can mean "and" or "but," often adding a slight emphasis or contrast. (e.g., On je učitelj, **pa** ona je študentka - He is a teacher, and she is a student / He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jaz grem, **pa** ti ostaneš - I am going, and you are staying.)

# Character

## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb **biti** ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the **-l/-la/-lo/-li** form).

## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us *how*, *when*, *where*, or *to what extent* something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to **-o**.

* *Examples:* dobro (well, from dober - good), hitro (quickly, from hiter - quick), tiho (quietly, from tih - quiet), daleč (far).
* *In sentences:* On govori **dobro** (He speaks well). Ona teče **hitro** (She runs quickly). Živimo **daleč** (We live far away).

## Easy Comparisons: Višje and Kot/Od

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than' or 'taller/higher than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'boljši' - better, 'večji' - bigger) followed by the word **kot** or **od** (than). The word **višje** generally means 'higher' or 'above' and can be used when comparing physical height or level, or sometimes more abstractly. The standard comparative adjective for 'visok' (tall/high) is 'višji'.
