## Using Conjunctions: 'і', 'а', 'чи', 'або'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Some essential ones are:

*   __і/й:__ Means "and," connecting similar things. Use __й__ after a vowel, __і__ after a consonant or at the beginning of a sentence. (e.g., Я __і__ ти - I and you. Чита́ю __й__ пишу́ - I read and write.)
*   __а:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Він учи́тель, __а__ вона́ студе́нтка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я йду, __а__ ти залиша́єшся - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __чи:__ Means "or" when offering a choice or asking a question. (e.g., Ка́ва __чи__ чай? - Coffee or tea? Ти йдеш __чи__ залиша́єшся?)
*   __або:__ Also means "or," generally when presenting distinct alternatives. (e.g., Прийдіть сьо́годні __або__ за́втра - Come today or tomorrow.)
