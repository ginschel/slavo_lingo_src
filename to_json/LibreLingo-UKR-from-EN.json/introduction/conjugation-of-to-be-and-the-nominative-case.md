## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Ukrainian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'Byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__бути__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The forms for the present tense are:

*   Я __є__ (rarely used, usually omitted) / __Я єсмь__ (archaic) / __Я єсьм__ (archaic) (I am)
*   Ти __є__ (rarely used, usually omitted) / __Ти єси__ (archaic) (You are, singular informal)
*   Він/Вона/Воно __є__ (rarely used, usually omitted) / __Він єсть__ (archaic) (He/She/It is)
*   Ми __є__ (rarely used, usually omitted) / __Ми єсмо__ (archaic) (We are)
*   Ви __є__ (rarely used, usually omitted) / __Ви єсте__ (archaic) (You are, plural or singular formal)
*   Вони __є__ (rarely used, usually omitted) / __Вони суть__ (archaic) (They are)

In modern Ukrainian, the present tense forms of "бути" are almost always omitted, especially with nouns and adjectives, except for emphasis. Instead, the noun or adjective simply follows the subject.

*   _Examples:_ Я студент (I am a student). Моя сестра добра (My sister is good). Ми добрі друзі (We are good friends). Вони тут (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Ukrainian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a hard consonant are masculine (e.g., __стіл__ - table, __учитель__ - teacher). Also, some nouns ending in a soft sign (-ь) are masculine (e.g., __день__ - day).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__а__ or -__я__ are feminine (e.g., __жінка__ - woman, __книжка__ - book, __земля__ - earth/land). Also, some nouns ending in a soft sign (-ь) are feminine (e.g., __ніч__ - night).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__о__, -__е__, or -__я__ (after a soft consonant or vowel) are neuter (e.g., __вікно__ - window, __поле__ - field, __море__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with nouns ending in -ь, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural nouns often end in -__и__, -__і__, or -__а__/-__я__.
    
    *   _Examples:_ Singular: __стіл__ (m), __жінка__ (f), __вікно__ (n). Plural: __столи́__, __жі́нки__, __ві́кна__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __добрий__ (m), __добра__ (f), __добре__ (n). Plural: __добрі__ (all genders).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __синій__ (m), __синя__ (f), __синє__ (n). Plural: __сині__ (all genders).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Добрий дім__ старий (A good house is old). __Зелені поля__ зелені (Green fields are green). __Красиві жінки__ говорять (Beautiful women are speaking). __Сині очі__ красиві (Blue eyes are beautiful).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __цей__ (m), __ця__ (f), __це__ (n) - (this/that)
*   __Plural:__ __ці__ (all genders) - (these/those)
*   _Examples:_ __Цей__ дім великий (This/That house is big). __Ця__ книжка моя (This/That book is mine). __Це__ наше місто (This/That is our city). __Ці__ люди веселі (These/Those people are cheerful).
