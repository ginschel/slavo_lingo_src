## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the __-в/-л/-ла/-ло/-ли__ form) followed by the conditional particle __би__. The particle __би__ is usually placed after the verb or the subject, but can also appear after other words for emphasis.

*   _Formation:_ Past tense (l-form) + particle __би__
*   _Examples:_ Я __чита́в би__ (m.) / __чита́ла би__ (f.) ту кни́жку (I would read that book). Він __пішо́в би__ в кін__о́__ (He would go to the cinema). Ми __зроби́ли б__ це все ра́зом (We would do that all together - __би__ can shorten to __б__ after a vowel). Що __б ви хотíли__? (What would you like? - __би__ after a vowel).
