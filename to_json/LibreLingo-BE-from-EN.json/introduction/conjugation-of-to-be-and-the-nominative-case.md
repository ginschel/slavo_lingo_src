## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Belarusian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'Byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__быць__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The forms for the present tense are:

*   Я __ёсць__ (I am)
*   Ты __ёсць__ (You are, singular informal)
*   Ён/Яна/Яно __ёсць__ (He/She/It is)
*   Мы __ёсць__ (We are)
*   Вы __ёсць__ (You are, plural or singular formal)
*   Яны __ёсць__ (They are)

While the full present tense forms exist, they are often omitted in modern Belarusian, similar to Ukrainian and Russian, especially when connecting a noun or pronoun subject to a noun or adjective predicate.

*   _Examples:_ Я студэнт (I am a student). Мая сястра добрая (My sister is good). Мы добрыя сябры (We are good friends). Яны тут (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Belarusian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __стол__ - table, __настаўнік__ - teacher). Some nouns ending in -ь are masculine (e.g., __дзень__ - day).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__а__ or -__я__ are feminine (e.g., __жанчына__ - woman, __кніга__ - book, __зямля__ - earth/land). Some nouns ending in -ь are feminine (e.g., __ноч__ - night).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__о__, -__е__, or -__я__ (after a soft consonant or vowel) are neuter (e.g., __акно__ - window, __поле__ - field, __мора__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with nouns ending in -ь, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural nouns often end in -__ы__, -__і__, or -__а__/-__я__.
    
    *   _Examples:_ Singular: __стол__ (m), __жанчына__ (f), __акно́__ (n). Plural: __сталы́__, __жа́нчыны__, __во́кны__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __до́бры__ (m), __до́брая__ (f), __до́брае__ (n). Plural: __до́брыя__ (all genders).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __сíні__ (m), __сíняя__ (f), __сíняе__ (n). Plural: __сíнія__ (all genders).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __До́бры дом__ стары́ (A good house is old). __Зялёныя палі́__ зялёныя (Green fields are green). __Прыго́жыя жа́нчыны__ гаво́раць (Beautiful women are speaking). __Сíнія во́чы__ прыго́жыя (Blue eyes are beautiful).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __гэ́ты__ (m), __гэ́тая__ (f), __гэ́тае__ (n) - (this) / __той__ (m), __тая́__ (f), __тое__ (n) - (that)
*   __Plural:__ __гэ́тыя__ (all genders) - (these) / __тыя́__ (all genders) - (those)
*   _Examples:_ __Гэ́ты__ дом вялі́кі (This house is big). __Тая́__ кнíга мая́ (That book is mine). __Тое__ наша мястэ́чка (That is our small town). __Гэ́тыя__ лю́дзі вясёлыя (These people are cheerful).
