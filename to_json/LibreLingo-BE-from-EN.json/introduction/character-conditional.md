## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the __-ў/-л/-ла/-ло/-лі__ form) followed by the conditional particle __бы__. The particle __бы__ is usually placed after the verb or the subject, but can also appear after other words for emphasis.

*   _Formation:_ Past tense (l-form) + particle __бы__
*   _Examples:_ Я __чыта́ў бы__ (m.) / __чыта́ла бы__ (f.) тую́ кнíгу (I would read that book). Ён __пайшо́ў бы__ ў кін__о́__ (He would go to the cinema). Мы __зрабі́лі б__ гэта ўсё ра́зам (We would do that all together - __бы__ can shorten to __б__ after a vowel). Што __б вы хаце́лі__? (What would you like? - __бы__ after a vowel).
