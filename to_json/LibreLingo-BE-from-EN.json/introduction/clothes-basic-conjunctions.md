## Using Conjunctions: 'і', 'а', 'цi', 'або'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Some essential ones are:

*   __і/і́:__ Means "and," connecting similar things. Use __і́__ at the beginning of a sentence or after a vowel for emphasis, __і__ after a consonant. (e.g., Я __і__ ты - I and you. Чыта́ю __і́__ пішу́ - I read and write.)
*   __а:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Ён настаўнік, __а__ яна́ студэ́нтка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я іду́, __а__ ты застае́шся - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __цi:__ Means "or" when offering a choice or asking a question. (e.g., Ка́ва __цi__ чай? - Coffee or tea? Ты ідзе́ш __цi__ застае́шся?)
*   __або:__ Also means "or," generally when presenting distinct alternatives. (e.g., Прыйдзі́це сёння __або__ за́ўтра - Come today or tomorrow.)
