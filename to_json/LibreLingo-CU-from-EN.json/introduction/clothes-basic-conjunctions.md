## Using Conjunctions: 'и҆', 'а', 'и҆лѝ'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __и҆/ѝ:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. Use __ѝ__ before a vowel, __и҆__ before a consonant. (e.g., А́зъ __и҆__ тꙑ̀ - I and you. Чита́ю __ѝ__ пишꙋ̀ - I read and write.)
*   __а:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., То́й є҆́сть оучи́тель, __а__ та̀ є҆́сть оучени́ца - He is a teacher, but she is a student. А́зъ идꙋ̀, __а__ тꙑ̀ о҆стае́ши сѧ - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __и҆лѝ:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Ка́ва __и҆лѝ__ ча́й? - Coffee or tea? Придѣ́те __и҆лѝ__ о҆ста́нете сѧ до́ма? - Will you come or stay at home?)
