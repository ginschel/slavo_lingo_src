## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Church Slavonic language. Church Slavonic is a venerable liturgical language with features inherited from Old Church Slavonic, including a richer case system and dual number, which differ from most modern Slavic languages. Understanding its structure is key.

## Conjugation of 'бы́ти' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__бы́ти__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. Church Slavonic has singular, dual (for two), and plural forms in the present tense.

*   __Singular:__
    
    *   А́зъ __е҆́смь__ (I am)
    *   Тꙑ̀ __е҆сѝ__ (You are)
    *   То́й/Та̀/То̀ __е҆́сть__ (He/She/It is)
    
    
    
*   __Dual:__
    
    *   Вѣ̀ __е҆свѣ̀__ (We two are)
    *   Въі __е҆ста̀__ (You two are)
    *   О́нѣ/Та̀ __е҆стѣ̀__ (They two are - masc/neuter / They two are - fem)
    
    
    
*   __Plural:__
    
    *   Мꙑ̀ __е҆смы̀__ (We are)
    *   Вꙑ̀ __е҆стѐ__ (You are)
    *   О́ни/Та̀ __сꙋ́ть__ (They are - masc/neuter / They are - fem)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ А́зъ __е҆́смь__ ра́бъ (I am a servant). Та̀ __е҆́сть__ добра̀ (She is good). Мꙑ̀ __е҆смы̀__ до́бри ра́би (We are good servants). О́ни __сꙋ́ть__ здѣ̀ (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Church Slavonic nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun, as well as noun declension patterns. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a hard or soft consonant are masculine (e.g., __до́мъ__ - house, __сто́лъ__ - table, __о҆те́цъ__ - father, __мꙋ́жъ__ - man).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__а__ or -__ꙗ__ (after a soft consonant or vowel) are feminine (e.g., __жена̀__ - woman, __кни́га__ - book, __землѧ̀__ - earth/land). Some nouns ending in a consonant are feminine (e.g., __но́щь__ - night).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__о__ or -__е__ are neuter (e.g., __село̀__ - village, __мо́ре__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with consonant-ending feminine nouns, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular, dual, and plural forms vary based on gender and declension class.
    
    *   _Hard Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __до́мъ__. Du: __до́ма__. Pl: __до́ми__.
    *   _Soft Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __мꙋ́жъ__. Du: __мꙋ́жа__. Pl: __мꙋ́жи__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __жена̀__. Du: __женѣ̀__. Pl: __же́ны__. Sg: __но́щь__. Du: __но́щи__. Pl: __но́щи__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __село̀__. Du: __селѣ̀__. Pl: __се́ла__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and case with the noun they describe. Church Slavonic adjectives have different endings for hard (ь-stem) and soft (j-stem) stems, and also distinguish between short (indefinite) and long (definite) forms. Here we show the short/indefinite forms in the nominative.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Sg: __до́бръ__ (m), __добра̀__ (f), __до́бро__ (n). Du: __до́бра__ (m/n), __до́брѣ__ (f). Pl: __до́бри__ (m), __до́бры__ (f), __до́бра__ (n).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Sg: __сíнїи__ (m), __сíнѧѧ__ (f), __сíнѣе__ (n). Du: __сíнѧѧ__ (m/n), __сíнїи__ (f). Pl: __сíнїи__ (m), __сíнѧѧ__ (f/n).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __До́бръ до́мъ__ є҆́сть ста́ръ (A good house is old). __Сíнѣе мо́ре__ є҆́сть велико (The blue sea is big). __Кра́сны__ же́ны гово́рѧтъ (Beautiful women are speaking). __ѩ́гньчии гла́съ__ є҆́сть то́нъ (A lamb's voice is thin).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that." In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number (singular, dual, plural) of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __се́й__ (m), __сїѧ̀__ (f), __сіѐ__ (n) - (this) / __то́й__ (m), __та̀__ (f), __то̀__ (n) - (that - often referring to something already mentioned or less specific)
*   __Dual:__ __сїѧ̑__ (m/n), __сѝи__ (f) - (these two) / __та́__ (m/n), __тѣ́__ (f) - (those two)
*   __Plural:__ __сѝи__ (m), __сꙗ̑__ (f/n) - (these) / __тѝи__ (m), __тꙗ̑__ (f/n) - (those)
*   _Examples:_ __Се́й__ до́мъ є҆́сть велі́къ (This house is big). __Сїѧ̀__ кни́га є҆́сть моѧ̀ (This book is mine). __Сіѐ__ село̀ є҆́сть на́ше (This village is ours). __Сѝи__ лю́діє сꙋ́ть весе́ли (These people are cheerful).
