## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (кого or что receives the action). The __Locative case__ (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like __на__ (on) or __въ__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Ви́ждꙋ __до́мъ__ - I see a house, Ви́ждꙋ __село̀__ - I see a village)
    *   _Masculine Animate:_ Look like the Genitive (-а). (e.g., Ви́ждꙋ __о҆тца̀__ - I see a father)
    *   _Feminine:_ hard __-ꙋ́__, soft __-ю̀__. (e.g., Ви́ждꙋ __женꙋ̀__ - I see a woman, Ви́ждꙋ __зе́млю__ - I see land)
    
    
    
*   __Locative (Prepositional) with 'на/въ' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ hard __-ѣ́__, soft __-и__ or __-и__. (e.g., на __столѣ̀__ - on a table, въ __селѣ̀__ - in a village, на по́л__и__ - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ hard __-ѣ́__, soft __-и__. (e.g., на рѣц__ѣ̀__ - on a river, въ земл__ѝ__ - in the earth)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Чита́ѭ __кни́гꙋ__ (I am reading a book). Сѣди́мъ __на столѣ̀__ (We are sitting on a table).
