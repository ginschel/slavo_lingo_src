## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the aorist forms of the verb __бы́ти__ ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the __-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли__ form).

*   Aorist forms of 'бы́ти': __бꙑ́хъ, бꙑ́, бꙑ́, бꙑ́ховѣ, бꙑ́ста, бꙑ́стѣ, бꙑ́хомъ, бꙑ́сте, бꙑ́шѧ__
*   Formation: Aorist of 'бы́ти' + Past active participle (-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли)
*   _Examples:_ А́зъ __бꙑ́хъ чи́талъ__ (masc.) / __бꙑ́хъ чи́тала__ (fem.) тꙋ̀ кни́гꙋ (I would read that book). То́й __бꙑ́ є҆ді́нъ шє́лъ__ въ кино̀ (He would go to the cinema alone). Мꙑ̀ __бꙑ́хомъ сътвори́ли__ сіѐ всѐ вьсе́ю (We would do all this together). Что̀ __бꙑ́сте хотѣ́ли__? (What would you like?).
