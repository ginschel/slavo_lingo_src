## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Lower Sorbian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'Byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__byś__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The forms for the present tense are:

*   Ja __som__ (I am)
*   Ty __sy__ (You are, singular informal)
*   Wón/Wóna/Wóno __jo__ (He/She/It is)
*   My __smy__ (We are)
*   Wy __sće__ (You are, plural or singular formal)
*   Wóni/Wone __su__ (They (masculine personal/neuter) are / They (feminine/non-masculine personal) are)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __som__ student (I am a student). Moja sotša __jo__ dobra (My sister is good). My __smy__ dobri pśijaśele (We are good friends). Wóni __su__ how (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Lower Sorbian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __dom__ - house, __stoł__ - table, __wucabnik__ - teacher). Some nouns ending in -ś are masculine (e.g., __źeń__ - day).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ or -__ja__ are feminine (e.g., __žona__ - woman, __knigła__ - book, __zemja__ - earth/land). Some nouns ending in -ś are feminine (e.g., __noc__ - night).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__ or -__e__ are neuter (e.g., __wokno__ - window, __pólo__ - field).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with nouns ending in -ś, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural nouns often end in -__y__, -__i__, or -__a__/-__ja__.
    
    *   _Examples:_ Singular: __stoł__ (m), __žona__ (f), __wokno__ (n). Plural: __stoły__, __žony__, __wokna__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __dobry__ (m), __dobra__ (f), __dobre__ (n). Plural: __dobre__ (all genders).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __něžny__ (m), __něžna__ (f), __něžne__ (n). Plural: __něžne__ (all genders).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dobry dom__ stary (A good house is old). __Zelene póla__ zelene (Green fields are green). __Krasne žony__ powědaju (Beautiful women are speaking). __Něžne kwěśe__ jo krasne (Tender flowers are beautiful).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __toś ten__ (m), __toś ta__ (f), __toś to__ (n) - (this/that)
*   __Plural:__ __toś te__ (all genders) - (these/those)
*   _Examples:_ __Toś ten__ dom wjeliki (This/That house is big). __Toś ta__ knigła moja (This/That book is mine). __Toś to__ jo naše město (This/That is our city). __Toś te__ luźe su wjasołe (These/Those people are cheerful).
