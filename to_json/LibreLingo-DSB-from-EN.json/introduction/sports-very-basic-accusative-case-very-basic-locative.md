## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The __Locative case__ (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __w__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Ja wiźim __stoł__ - I see a table, Ja wiźim __město__ - I see a city)
    *   _Masculine Animate:_ Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Ja wiźim __nanśa__ - I see a father)
    *   _Feminine:_ End in __-u__ (hard) / __-u__ (soft). (e.g., Ja wiźim __žonu__ - I see a woman, Ja wiźim __knigłu__ - I see a book)
    
    
    
*   __Locative (Prepositional) with 'na/w' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ Ends in __-u__. (e.g., na __stol__u - on a table, w __měsć__e - in a city, na __pól__u - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ Ends in __-e__. (e.g., na __rěk__e - on a river, w __zemj__i - in the earth, w __škol__e - in a school)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Ja cytam __knigłu__ (I am reading a book). Smy seźimy __na stolu__ (We are sitting on a table).
