## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb __biti__ ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the __-l/-la/-lo/-li__ form).

*   Conditional forms of 'biti': __bi__ (for all persons and numbers)
*   Formation: Conditional 'bi' + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)
*   _Examples:_ Jaz __bi bral__ (masc.) / __bi brala__ (fem.) to knjigo (I would read that book). On __bi Å¡el__ v kino (He would go to the cinema). Midva __bi delala__ to vse skupaj (We two would do that all together). Kaj __bi__ vi __hoteli__? (What would you like?).
