## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining the future tense of the verb __biti__ ('to be') with the past active participle of the main verb. For perfective verbs, you use the simple future tense form (one word).

*   Compound Future ('biti' + Past Active Participle - for imperfective verbs): bom, boš, bo, bova/bosta/bosta, bomo, boste, bodo + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)
*   Simple Future (for perfective verbs): Formed using the present tense stem of the perfective verb.
*   _Examples (Compound Future - imperfective):_ Jaz __bom bral__ knjigo (I will read a book). Ti __boš govoril__ z njim (You will talk with him). Ona __bo delala__ jutri (She will work tomorrow). Midva __bova pisala__ (We two will write). Oni __bodo gledali__ film (They will watch a film).
*   _Examples (Simple Future - perfective):_ Jaz __preberem__ knjigo (I will read a book). Ti __poveš__ mu (You will tell him). Ona __naredi__ to (She will do it).
