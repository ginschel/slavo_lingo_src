## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (koga or kaj receives the action). The __Locative case__ is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __v__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidim __grad__ - I see a castle, Vidim __mesto__ - I see a city)
    *   _Masculine Animate:_ Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim __očeta__ - I see a father)
    *   _Feminine:_ Ending __-o__. (e.g., Vidim __žensko__ - I see a woman, Vidim __knjigo__ - I see a book)
    
    
    
*   __Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ Ends in __-u__. (e.g., na __stolu__ - on a table, v __mestu__ - in a city, na __polju__ - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ Ends in __-i__. (e.g., na __reki__ - on a river, v __zemlji__ - in the earth)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Berem __knjigo__ (I am reading a book). Sedim __na stolu__ (I am sitting on a table).
