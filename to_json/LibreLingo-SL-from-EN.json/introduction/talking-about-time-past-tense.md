## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense. This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in __-l__ (for masculine singular), __-la__ (for feminine singular), __-lo__ (for neuter singular), __-la__ (for dual masculine), __-li__ (for dual feminine/neuter), or __-li__ (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding present tense form of the verb __biti__ is used for all persons _except_ the third person singular and plural, where it is often omitted.

*   Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    
    *   Masculine Singular: -__l__ (followed by appropriate form of _biti_) - On bral (He read)
    *   Feminine Singular: -__la__ (followed by appropriate form of _biti_) - Ona bra__la__ (She read)
    *   Neuter Singular: -__lo__ (followed by appropriate form of _biti_) - Ono bra__lo__ (It read)
    *   Dual Masculine: -__la__ (followed by appropriate form of _biti_) - Midva bra__la__ (We two read)
    *   Dual Feminine/Neuter: -__li__ (followed by appropriate form of _biti_) - Midve bra__li__, Mesti bra__li__ (We two read, Two cities read)
    *   Plural (all genders): -__li__ (followed by appropriate form of _biti_) - Mi bra__li__, Oni bra__li__ (We read, They read)
