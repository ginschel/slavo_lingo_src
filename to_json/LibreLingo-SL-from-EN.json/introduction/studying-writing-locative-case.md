## The Proper Locative Case: Location and Topic

The __Locative case__ is used for location ('in', 'on', 'at') or the topic of discussion ('about'). It is unique because it is _always_ used with a preposition, such as __v/pri/na/ob/po__ (in/at/on/by/along) or __o/ob__ (about). Slovenian has singular, dual, and plural forms for the Locative case.
