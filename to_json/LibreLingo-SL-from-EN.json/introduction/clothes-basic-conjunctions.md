## Using Conjunctions: 'in', 'ali', 'pa'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __in:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jaz __in__ ti - I and you. Berem __in__ pišem - I read and write.)
*   __ali:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava __ali__ čaj? - Coffee or tea? Boste prišli __ali__ ostali doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
*   __pa:__ Can mean "and" or "but," often adding a slight emphasis or contrast. (e.g., On je učitelj, __pa__ ona je študentka - He is a teacher, and she is a student / He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jaz grem, __pa__ ti ostaneš - I am going, and you are staying.)
