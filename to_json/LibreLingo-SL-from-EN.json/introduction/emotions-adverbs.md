## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-o__.

*   _Examples:_ dobro (well, from dober - good), hitro (quickly, from hiter - quick), tiho (quietly, from tih - quiet), daleč (far).
*   _In sentences:_ On govori __dobro__ (He speaks well). Ona teče __hitro__ (She runs quickly). Živimo __daleč__ (We live far away).
