## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Slovenian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'biti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__biti__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. Slovenian has singular, dual (for two), and plural forms.

*   __Singular:__
    
    *   Jaz __sem__ (I am)

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Slovenian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __dom__ - house, __stol__ - table, __učitelj__ - teacher).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ are feminine (e.g., __žena__ - woman, __knjiga__ - book, __zemlja__ - earth/land).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__ or -__e__ are neuter (e.g., __mesto__ - city, __morje__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular, dual, and plural forms vary based on gender.
    
    *   _Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __dom__. Du: __doma__. Pl: __domovi__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __žena__. Du: __ženi__. Pl: __žene__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __mesto__. Du: __mesti__. Pl: __mesta__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and case with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __dober__ (m), __dobra__ (f), __dobro__ (n). Dual: __dobra__ (m/n), __dobri__ (f). Plural: __dobri__ (m), __dobre__ (f/n).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __svež__ (m), __sveža__ (f), __sveže__ (n). Dual: __sveža__ (m/n), __sveži__ (f). Plural: __sveži__ (m), __sveže__ (f/n).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dober dom__ je star (A good house is old). __Sveža polja__ so zelena (Fresh fields are green). __Lepe ženske__ govorijo (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number (singular, dual, plural) of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __ta__ (m), __ta__ (f), __to__ (n) - (this/that)
*   __Dual:__ __ta__ (m), __ti__ (f), __ti__ (n) - (these/those two)
*   __Plural:__ __ti__ (m), __te__ (f), __ta__ (n) - (these/those)
*   _Examples:_ __Ta__ dom je velik (This/That house is big). __Ta__ knjiga je moja (This/That book is mine). __To__ je naše mesto (This/That is our city). __Ti__ ljudje so veseli (These/Those people are cheerful).
