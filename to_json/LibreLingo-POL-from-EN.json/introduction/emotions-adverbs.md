## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-o__ or __-e__.

*   _Examples:_ dobrze (well, from dobry - good), szybko (quickly, from szybki - quick), cicho (quietly, from cichy - quiet), daleko (far).
*   _In sentences:_ On mówi __dobrze__ (He speaks well). Ona biega __szybko__ (She runs quickly). Żyjemy __daleko__ (We live far away).
