## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the __-ł/-ła/-ło/-li/-ły__ form) followed by the conjugated conditional particle __by__. The particle __by__ often appears directly after the verb or the subject.

*   _Formation:_ Past tense (l-form) + conjugated form of __by__ (bym, byś, by, byśmy, byście, by)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __czytałbym__ (m.) / __czytałabym__ (ż.) tę książkę (I would read that book). On __poszedłby__ do kina (He would go to the cinema). My __zrobilibyśmy__ to wszystko razem (We would do that all together). Co __chcielibyście__? (What would you like? - using the past tense plural form for 'wy').
