## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'lub', 'a'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __i:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja __i__ ty - I and you. Czytam __i__ piszę - I read and write.)
*   __lub:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa __lub__ herbata? - Coffee or tea? Przyjdziecie __lub__ zostaniecie w domu? - Will you come or stay home?)
*   __a:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On jest nauczycielem, __a__ ona jest studentką - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idę, __a__ ty zostajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
