## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's begin with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The __Locative case__ is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __w__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widzę __dom__ - I see a house, Widzę __miasto__ - I see a city)
    *   _Feminine:_ End in __-ę__. (e.g., Widzę __kobietę__ - I see a woman, Widzę __książkę__ - I see a book)
    
    
    
*   __Locative with 'na/w' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ Ends in __-e__ or __-u__. (e.g., na __stole__ - on a table, w __mieście__ - in a city, na __polu__ - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ Often end in __-e__ or __-i__ (after a soft consonant). (e.g., na __rzece__ - on a river, w __ziemi__ - in the earth, w __szkole__ - in a school)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Czytam __książkę__ (I am reading a book). Siedzimy __na stole__ (We are sitting on a table).
