## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-o__ or __-e__.

*   _Examples:_ dobrze (well, from dobri - good), chùtczi (quickly, from chùtczi - quick), cëchò (quietly, from cëchi - quiet), dalekò (far).
*   _In sentences:_ Òn gôdô __dobrze__ (He speaks well). Òna biégô __chùtczi__ (She runs quickly). Mieszkómë __dalekò__ (We live far away).
