## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (kògò or co receives the action). The __Locative case__ is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __w__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widzã __dom__ - I see a house, Widzã __sélko__ - I see a small village)
    *   _Masculine Animate:_ Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widzã __òjca__ - I see a father)
    *   _Feminine:_ End in __-ã__ or __-ą__. (e.g., Widzã \*\* białkã__ - I see a woman, Widzã __knégã\*\* - I see a book)
    
    
    
*   __Locative with 'na/w' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ Ends in __-u__. (e.g., na __stolu__ - on a table, w __sélku__ - in a small village)
    *   _Feminine:_ Often end in __-e__ or __-i__. (e.g., na __rece__ - on a river, na __zemi__ - on land)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Czëtóm __knégã__ (I am reading a book - Accusative feminine ending). Sedzëma __na stolu__ (We are sitting on a table).
