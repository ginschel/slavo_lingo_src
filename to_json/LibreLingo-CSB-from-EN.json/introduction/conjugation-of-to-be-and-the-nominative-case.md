## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Kashubian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Kashubian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __dom__ - house, __stół__ - table, __ùczëcel__ - teacher).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ or -__ô__ are feminine (e.g., \*\* białka__ - woman, __knéga__ - book, __zemia\*\* - earth/land).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__ or -__e__ are neuter (e.g., __wòkno__ - window, __pòle__ - field).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural forms vary based on gender.
    
    *   _Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __dom__. Pl: __domë__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: \*\* białka__. Pl: \*\* białczi__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __wòkno__. Pl: __wòkna__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __dobri__ (m), __dobrô__ (f), __dobré__ (n). Plural: __dobri__ (masculine personal), __dobré__ (other genders/non-masculine personal).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __juńdżi__ (m), __juńdżô__ (f), __juńdzé__ (n). Plural: __juńdżi__ (masculine personal), __juńdzé__ (other genders/non-masculine personal).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dobri dom__ je stôri (A good house is old). __Juńdzé pòla__ sã zeléne (Other fields are green). __Pòkné białczi__ gôdają (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __tén__ (m), __tô__ (f), __to__ (n) - (this/that)
*   __Plural:__ __ci__ (masculine personal), __té__ (other genders/non-masculine personal) - (these/those)
*   _Examples:_ __Tén__ dom je wiôldżi (This/That house is big). __Tô__ knéga je mòja (This/That book is mine). __To__ je najszé pòle (This/That is our field). __Ci__ lëdze sã weseli (These/Those people are cheerful).
