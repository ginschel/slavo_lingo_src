## Using Conjunctions: 'ë', 'a', 'abò'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __ë:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jô __ë__ të - I and you. Czëtóm __ë__ piszę - I read and write.)
*   __a:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Òn je ùczëcel, __a__ òna je sztudéntka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jô jidã, __a__ të òstajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __abò:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa __abò__ téj? - Coffee or tea? Przëńdzece __abò__ òstanace doma? - Will you come or stay at home?)
