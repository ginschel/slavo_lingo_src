## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the particle __bë__ (or __bëch__, __bës__, __bë__, etc., depending on dialect and person) combined with the past participle of the main verb (the __-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë__ form).

*   Formation: Conditional particle ('bë' or conjugated form) + Past participle (-ł/-ła/-ło/-lë)
*   _Examples:_ Jô __bëczëtôł__ (masc.) / __bë czëtôła__ (fem.) tą knégã (I would read that book). Òn __bë szedł__ do kina (He would go to the cinema). Më __bë robilë__ to wszëtkò razã (We would do that all together). Czë to __bë wë chcële__? (What would you like?).
