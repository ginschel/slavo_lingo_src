## The Future Tense

To express actions that will happen in the future using imperfective verbs, you typically form it by combining the future tense of the verb __bëc__ ('to be') with the infinitive of the main verb, or using the simple future for perfective verbs.

*   Compound Future ('bëc' + Infinitive - for imperfective verbs): bùdã, bùdzesz, bùdze, bùdzemë, bùdzece, bùdą + Infinitive.
*   Simple Future (for perfective verbs): Formed using the present tense conjugation of the perfective verb.
*   _Examples (Compound Future - imperfective):_ Jô __bùdã czëtac__ knégã (I will read a book). Të __bùdzesz gôdac__ z nim (You will talk with him). Òna __bùdze robic__ jutrã (She will work tomorrow). Më __bùdzemë pisac__ (We will write). Òni __bùdą kùkac__ na film (They will watch a film).
*   _Examples (Simple Future - perfective):_ Jô __przeczëtóm__ knégã (I will read a book). Të __pòwiesz__ mù (You will tell him). Òna __zrobi__ to (She will do it).
