## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's begin with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The __Locative case__ (also called Miejscownik) is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __we__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Widza __stół__ - I see a table, Widza __pole__ - I see a field)
    *   _Masculine Animate:_ Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Widza __ôjca__ - I see a father)
    *   _Feminine:_ End in __-a__ (hard) / __-io__ (soft). (e.g., Widza __babã__ - I see a woman, Widza __ziymiã__ - I see land)
    
    
    
*   __Locative (Miejscownik) with 'na/we' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ Ends in __-u__. (e.g., na __stole__ - on a table, we __polu__ - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ Often end in __-e__ or __-i__. (e.g., na __rzyce__ - on a river, na __ziymi__ - on land)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Czytóm __ksiůnżka__ (I am reading a book - Accusative feminine ending). Siedzymy __na stole__ (We are sitting on a table).
