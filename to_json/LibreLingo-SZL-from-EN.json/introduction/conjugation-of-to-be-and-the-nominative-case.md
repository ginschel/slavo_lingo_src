## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Silesian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'być' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__być__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The forms for the present tense are:

*   Jo __żech je__ (I am) - _colloquial, common_
*   Ty __żeś je__ (You are, singular informal) - _colloquial, common_
*   On/Ona/Ono __je__ (He/She/It is)
*   My __żeśmy są__ (We are) - _colloquial, common_
*   Wy __żeście są__ (You are, plural or singular formal) - _colloquial, common_
*   Oni/One __są__ (They are)

Note that the colloquial forms with "że" are very common in spoken Silesian.

*   _Examples:_ Jo __żech je__ studentym (I am a student). Moja siostra __je__ dobra (My sister is good). My __żeśmy są__ dobrzi kamraci (We are good friends). Łoni __są__ sam (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Silesian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __dom__ - house, __stół__ - table, __ućytel__ - teacher). Some nouns ending in -ś or -ź are masculine (e.g., __źyńś__ - day).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ or -__io__ are feminine (e.g., __baba__ - woman, __ksiůnżka__ - book, __ziymia__ - earth/land). Some nouns ending in a consonant are feminine (e.g., __nocka__ - night).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__, -__e__, or -__y__/-__i__ are neuter (e.g., __ôkno__ - window, __pole__ - field, __szczyńści__ - happiness).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural nouns often end in -__y__/-__i__ or -__a__.
    
    *   _Examples:_ Singular: __stół__ (m), __baba__ (f), __ôkno__ (n). Plural: __stoły__, __baby__, __ôkna__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __dobry__ (m), __dobra__ (f), __dobre__ (n). Plural: __dobry__ (masculine personal), __dobre__ (other genders/non-masculine personal).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __inšy__ (m), __inšo__ (f), __inše__ (n). Plural: __inšy__ (masculine personal), __inše__ (other genders/non-masculine personal).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dobry dom__ je stary (A good house is old). __Zielone pola__ sům zielone (Green fields are green). __Piynkne baby__ gŏdajům (Beautiful women are speaking). __Inše ôkna__ sům fechne (Other windows are cool).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __tyn__ (m), __ta__ (f), __to__ (n) - (this/that)
*   __Plural:__ __ci__ (masculine personal), __te__ (other genders/non-masculine personal) - (these/those)
*   _Examples:_ __Tyn__ dom je wielgi (This/That house is big). __Ta__ ksiůnżka je moja (This/That book is mine). __To__ je nasze pole (This/That is our field). __Ci__ ludzie sům wieseli (These/Those people are cheerful).
