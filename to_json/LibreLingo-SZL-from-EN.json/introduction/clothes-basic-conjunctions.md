## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'a', 'abo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __i:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Jo __i__ ty - I and you. Czytóm __i__ pisza - I read and write.)
*   __a:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Łon je utytelem, __a__ łona je študyntkům - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Jo ida, __a__ ty zostajesz - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __abo:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa __abo__ tukej? - Coffee or here? Przijedziecie __abo__ zostaniecie doma? - Will you come or stay at home?)
