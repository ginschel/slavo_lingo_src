## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the __-ł/-ła/-ło/-li__ form) followed by the conditional particle __by__. The particle __by__ is usually placed after the verb or the subject.

*   _Formation:_ Past tense (l-form) + particle __by__
*   _Examples:_ Jo __czytoł by__ (m.) / __czytoła by__ (f.) ta ksiůnżka (I would read that book). Łon __poszoł by__ do kina (He would go to the cinema). My __robili by__ to wszyjsko razym (We would do that all together). Co __byście chciele__? (What would you like? - using the past tense plural form for 'wy').
