## Using Conjunctions: 'a', 'a a', 'abo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __a:__ Means "and" or "but," often showing a slight contrast or connection. (e.g., Ja __a__ ty - I and you. Čitam __a__ pisam - I read and write).
*   __a a:__ Means "and," connecting similar items in a list. (e.g., Ja, __a a__ ty, __a a__ wón - I, and you, and he).
*   __abo:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kawa __abo__ tej? - Coffee or tea? Budźeće __abo__ wostanace doma? - Will you come or stay home?).
