## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-o__ or __-e__.

*   _Examples:_ derje (well, from dobry - good), spěšnje (quickly, from spěšny - quick), ćicho (quietly, from ćichy - quiet), daloko (far).
*   _In sentences:_ Wón rěči __derje__ (He speaks well). Wona běži __spěšnje__ (She runs quickly). Bydlimy __daloko__ (We live far away).
