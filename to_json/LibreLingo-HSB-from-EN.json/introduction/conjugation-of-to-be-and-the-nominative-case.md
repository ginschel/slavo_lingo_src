## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Upper Sorbian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'być' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__być__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. Upper Sorbian has singular, dual (for two), and plural forms.

*   __Singular:__
    
    *   Ja __sym__ (I am)
    *   Ty __sy__ (You are, singular informal)
    *   Wón/Wona/Wono __je__ (He/She/It is)
    
    
    
*   __Dual:__
    
    *   Mydwě __smy__ (We two are)
    *   Wudwě __staj__ (You two are)
    *   Wobaj/Wobě/Wonej __stej__ (They two are - masc/fem/neuter)
    
    
    
*   __Plural:__
    
    *   My __smy__ (We are)
    *   Wy __sće__ (You are)
    *   Woni/Wone __su__ (They are)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Ja __sym__ student (I am a student). Moja sotra __je__ dobra (My sister is good). Mydwě __smy__ dobrej přećelej (We two are good friends). Woni __su__ tu (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Upper Sorbian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __dom__ - house, __stól__ - table, __učer__ - teacher).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ or -__ja__ are feminine (e.g., __žona__ - woman, __kniha__ - book, __zemja__ - earth/land).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__ or -__e__ are neuter (e.g., __wokno__ - window, __pole__ - field).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular, dual, and plural forms vary based on gender.
    
    *   _Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __dom__. Du: __domaj__. Pl: __domy__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __žona__. Du: __žonje__. Pl: __žony__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __wokno__. Du: __woknjej__. Pl: __wokna__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and case with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __dobry__ (m), __dobra__ (f), __dobre__ (n). Dual: __dobrej__ (m/n), __dobrej__ (f). Plural: __dobri__ (m), __dobre__ (f/n).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __cyzy__ (m), __cyza__ (f), __cyze__ (n). Dual: __cyzej__ (m/n), __cyzej__ (f). Plural: __cyzi__ (m), __cyze__ (f/n).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dobry dom__ je stary (A good house is old). __Cyze kraje__ su zajimawe (Foreign countries are interesting). __Rjane žony__ rěča (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number (singular, dual, plural) of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __tutón__ (m), __tuta__ (f), __tute__ (n) - (this) / __tón__ (m), __ta__ (f), __to__ (n) - (that)
*   __Dual:__ __tutajšej__ (m), __tutej__ (f), __tutej__ (n) - (these two) / __tajšej__ (m), __tej__ (f), __tej__ (n) - (those two)
*   __Plural:__ __tuto__ (m), __tute__ (f/n) - (these) / __to__ (m), __te__ (f/n) - (those)
*   _Examples:_ __Tutón__ dom je wulki (This house is big). __Ta__ kniha je moja (That book is mine). __Tute__ je naše město (This is our city). __To__ ludźo su wjaseli (These people are cheerful).
