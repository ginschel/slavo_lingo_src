## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense. This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in __-ł__ (for masculine singular), __-ła__ (for feminine singular), __-ło__ (for neuter singular), __-łoj__ (for dual masculine), __-łoj__ (for dual feminine/neuter), or __-li__ (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding present tense form of the verb __być__ is used for all persons _except_ the third person singular and plural, where it is often omitted.

*   Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    
    *   Masculine Singular: -__ł__ (followed by appropriate form of _być_) - Wón čita__ł__ (He read)
    *   Feminine Singular: -__ła__ (followed by appropriate form of _być_) - Wona čita__ła__ (She read)
    *   Neuter Singular: -__ło__ (followed by appropriate form of _być_) - Wono čita__ło__ (It read)

    *   Dual Feminine/Neuter: -__łoj__ (followed by appropriate form of _być_) - Wudwě čita__łoj__, Wobaj čita__łoj__ (You two read, They two (masc) read)
    *   Plural (all genders): -__li__ (followed by appropriate form of _być_) - My čita__li__, Woni čita__li__ (We read, They read)
