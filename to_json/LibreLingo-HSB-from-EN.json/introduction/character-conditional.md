## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb __być__ ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the __-ł/-ła/-ło/-li__ form).

*   Conditional forms of 'być': __bych, by, by, bymaj, bytaj, bytaj, bychmy, byće, bychu__
*   Formation: Conditional 'być' form + Past active participle (-ł/-ła/-ło/-li)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __bych čitał__ (masc.) / __bych čitała__ (fem.) tu knih__u__ (I would read that book). Wón __by šoł__ do kina (He would go to the cinema). Mydwě __bymaj dźěłałoj__ to wšo zhromadnje (We two would do that all together). Što __byšće__ wy __chcěli__? (What would you like?).
