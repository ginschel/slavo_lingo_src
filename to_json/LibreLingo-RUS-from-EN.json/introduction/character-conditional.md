## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the __-л/-ла/-ло/-ли__ form) followed by the conditional particle __бы__. The particle __бы__ is usually placed after the verb or the subject, but can also appear after other words for emphasis.

*   _Formation:_ Past tense (l-form) + particle __бы__
*   _Examples:_ Я __чита́л бы__ (m.) / __чита́ла бы__ (f.) ту кни́гу (I would read that book). Он __пошёл бы__ в кино́ (He would go to the cinema). Мы __сде́лали бы__ это всё вме́сте (We would do that all together). Что __бы вы хоте́ли__? (What would you like? - __бы__ follows the question word).
