## Using Conjunctions: 'и', 'а', 'или'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __и:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Я __и__ ты - I and you. Я чита́ю __и__ пишу́ - I read and write.)
*   __а:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Он учи́тель, __а__ она́ студе́нтка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я иду́, __а__ ты остаёшься - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __или:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Ко́фе __или__ чай? - Coffee or tea? Вы придёте __или__ оста́нетесь до́ма? - Will you come or stay home?)
