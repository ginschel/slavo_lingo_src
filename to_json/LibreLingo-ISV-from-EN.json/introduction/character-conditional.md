## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional. This is formed using the past tense form of the verb (the __-l form__) followed by the conjugated conditional particle __by__. 
The particle __by__ often appears after the subject or the verb.

*   _Formation:_ Past tense (l-form) + conjugated form of __by__ (byh, bsy, by, byhmo, byste, by)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __čital byh__ (m.) / __čitala byh__ (f.) tu knigų (I would read that book). On __išel by__ do kina (He would go to the cinema). My __dělali byhmo__ to vsi zajedno (We would do that all together). čto __byste__ __hotěli__? (What would you like? - using past tense plural for 'vy')
