## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'ili', 'a'

Conjunctions are like glue words that connect words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __i:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja __i__ ty - I and you. Čitam __i__ pišu - I read and write.)
*   __ili:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava __ili__ čaj? - Coffee or tea? Pridete __ili__ ostanete doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
*   __a:__ Means "but" when showing contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On jest učitelj, __a__ ona jest studentka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idu, __a__ ty ostaniješ - I am going, and you are staying.)
