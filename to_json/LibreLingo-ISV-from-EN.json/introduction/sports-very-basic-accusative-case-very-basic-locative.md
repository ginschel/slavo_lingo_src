## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). 
The __Locative case__ is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __v__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change but let's keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masc Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like Nominative. (e.g., Vidim __dom__ - I see a house, Vidim __selo__ - I see a village)
    *   _Feminine:_ End in -__u__ or -__ju__. (e.g., Vidim __ženu__ - I see a woman, Vidim __zemju__ - I see land)
    
    
    
*   __Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masc/Neuter:_ Ends in __-u__. (e.g., na __stolu__ - on a table, v __polju__ - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ Often end in __-ě__ or __-i__(soft ending). (e.g., na __rěkě__ - on a river, na __zemji__ - on land)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Čitam __knigu__ (I am reading a book). Sidim __na stolu__ (We are sitting on a table).
