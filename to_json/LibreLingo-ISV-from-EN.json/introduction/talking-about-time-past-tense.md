## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past is done using the simple past tense. This is formed using a conjugated form of byti and the verb's past participle, which ends in __-l__. 
The ending of this '-l form' changes to match the gender and number of the subject. 

The form of to be can be omitted for the third person singular and plural.
* Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    * Masculine Singular: -__l__ (On čita__l__)
    * Feminine Singular: -__la__ (Ona čita__la__)
    * Neuter Singular: -__lo__ (Ono čita__lo__)
    * All Plural: -__li__ (Oni/One čita__li__)

*   _Examples:_ Včera jesm __rabotal__ (masc.) (Yesterday i worked). Včera ona __rabotala__ (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My jesmo __viděli__ film (We saw a film). Oni __pribyli__ pozdno (They arrived late).
