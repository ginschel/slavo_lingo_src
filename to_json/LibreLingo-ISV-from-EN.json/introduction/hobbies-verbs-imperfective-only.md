## Two Main Verb Conjugations (Imperfective)

Imperfective verbs describe actions that are ongoing, repeated, or not completed. In the present tense, most imperfective verbs follow one of two main patterns for their endings, depending on the verb's stem.

*   __Conjugation 1 (often -a- stem):__ Includes verbs like __čitati__ (to read), __dělati__ (to do). 'Ja' ends in -m, 'ty' in -š, etc.
    
    *   _Example: čitati_ -&gt; Ja čita__m__ (I read/am reading), Ty čita__š__ (You read/are reading), On/Ona/Ono čita (He/She/It reads/is reading), My čita__mo__ (We read/are reading), Vy čita__te__ (You read/are reading), Oni/One čita__jut__ (They read/are reading).
    
    
    
*   __Conjugation 2 (often -i-/-ě- stem):__ Includes verbs like __govoriti__ (to speak), __viděti__ (to see). 'Ja' often ends in -im (with possible consonant changes), 'ty' in -iš, etc.
    
    *   _Example: govoriti_ -&gt; Ja govori__m__ (I speak/am speaking), Ty govori__š__ (You speak/are speaking), On/Ona/Ono govori (He/She/It speaks/is speaking), My govori__mo__ (We speak/are speaking), Vy govori__te__ (You speak/are speaking), Oni/Ony govor__et__ (They speak/are speaking).
