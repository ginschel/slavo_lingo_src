## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-o__ or __-e__.

*   _Examples:_ dobro (well, from dobry - good), brzo (quickly, from brzy - quick), tiho (quietly, from tihy - quiet), daleko (far).
*   _In sentences:_ On govori __dobro__ (He speaks well). Ona běga __brzo__ (She runs quickly). Živemo __daleko__ (We live far away).
