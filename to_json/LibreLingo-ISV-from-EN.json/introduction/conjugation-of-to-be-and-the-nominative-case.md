## Welcome to the course!

The following grammar will be quite thorough but its essential to understand for learning Interslavic in case you are not slavic since you won't understand the logic behind the phrases very well.

But in case you speak a slavic language and you know how to use byti, how to detemine the gender of a word and the rest of the basics explained here, feel free to skip to the exercises.

## Conjugation of 'Byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__byti__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Like in many languages, its present tense forms are a bit special, but they are easy to learn. 
You use these to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to say where something is located.

*   Ja __jesm__ (I am)
*   Ty __jesi__ (You are, singular)
*   On/Ona/Ono __jest__ (He/She/It is)
*   My __jesmo__ (We are)
*   Vy __jeste__ (You are, plural or formal)
*   Oni/One __sut__ (They(male/neuter) are/They(female) are)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __jesm__ student (I am a student). Moja sestra __jest__ dobra (My sister is good). My __jesmo__ dobri prijatelji (We are good friends). Oni __sut__ tu (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Interslavic nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is important because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. 
Usually, the gender is clear from the noun's ending in its basic (nominative singular) form:

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __dom__ - house, __stol__ - table, __učitelj__ - teacher).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ or -__ja__ are feminine (e.g., __žena__ - woman, __kniga__ - book, __zemlja__ - land).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__ or -__e__ are neuter (e.g., __selo__ - village, __okno__ - window, __solnce__ - sun).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions, but these rules cover most words!

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the fundamental form of a noun or adjective, used mainly for the subject of a sentence (who or what is doing the action) or simply for naming things. It's the form you'll find words listed under in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules (consonant for M, -a/-ja for F, -o/-e for N). Plural nouns often end in -__y__ or -__i__ (hard/soft).
    
    *   _Hard:_ Sg: __dom__ (m), __žena__ (f), __selo__ (n). Pl: __domy__, __ženy__, __sela__.
    *   _Soft:_ Sg: __muž__ (m), __zemlja__ (f), __polje__ (n). Pl: __muži__, __zemlji__, __polja__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number.
    
    *   _Hard:_ Sg: __dobry__ (m), __dobra__ (f), __dobro__ (n). Pl: __dobri__ (virile), __dobre__ (non-virile).
    *   _Soft:_ Sg: __svěži__ (m), __svěža__ (f), __svěže__ (n). Pl: __svěži__ (virile), __svěže__ (non-virile).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dobry dom__ jest stary (A good house is old). __Svěže polja__ sut zelene (New fields are green). __Krasne ženy__ govorjat (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us point out specific nouns, like saying "this" or "that." In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __toj__ (m), __ta__ (f), __to__ (n) - (this/that)
*   __Plural:__ __ti__ (m/n) - (these/those) __te__ (non-virile) - (these/those)
*   _Examples:_ __Toj__ dom jest veliky (This/That house is big). __Ta__ kniga jest moja (This/That book is mine). __To__ jest naše selo (This/That is our village). __Ti__ ljudi sut veseli (These/Those people are cheerful).
