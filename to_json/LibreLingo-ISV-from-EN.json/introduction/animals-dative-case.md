## The Dative Case: To Whom? For Whom?

The __Dative case__ is used to show the indirect object of a verb – __to whom__ or __for whom__ an action is done. It's also used after certain verbs and prepositions (though we won't list all of them here). 
Its main purpose is to indicate the recipient of something or the beneficiary of an action.
