## Using Conjunctions: 'і', 'а', 'або'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __і:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Я __і__ ти - I and you. Читаю __і__ пишу - I read and write.)
*   __а:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Вон є учитель, __а__ она є штудентка - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Я иду, __а__ ти остаєш - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __або:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Кава __або__ чай? - Coffee or tea? Прийдете __або__ останете дома? - Will you come or stay home?)
