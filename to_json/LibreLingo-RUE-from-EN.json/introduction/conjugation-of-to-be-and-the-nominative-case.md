## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Rusin language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Rusin nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __дом__ - house, __стіл__ - table, __учитель__ - teacher).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__а__ or -__я__ are feminine (e.g., __жена__ - woman, __книга__ - book, __земля__ - earth/land).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__о__ or -__е__ are neuter (e.g., __село__ - village, __море__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural forms vary based on gender.
    
    *   _Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __дом__. Pl: __домы__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __жена__. Pl: __жены__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __село__. Pl: __села__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __добрый__ (m), __добра__ (f), __добре__ (n). Plural: __добры__ (all genders).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __синьый__ (m), __синя__ (f), __синє__ (n). Plural: __сині__ (all genders).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Добрый дом__ є старый (A good house is old). __Синє море__ є великоє (The blue sea is big). __Красны жены__ говорят (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __сей__ (m), __ся__ (f), __се__ (n) - (this) / __тот__ (m), __та__ (f), __то__ (n) - (that)
*   __Plural:__ __си__ (all genders) - (these) / __ти__ (all genders) - (those)
*   _Examples:_ __Сей__ дом є великый (This house is big). __Та__ книга є моя (That book is mine). __Се__ є наше село (This is our village). __Ти__ люде сут веселы (These people are cheerful).
