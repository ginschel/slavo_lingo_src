## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the particle __бы__ combined with the past active participle of the main verb (the __-в/-л/-ла/-ло/-ли__ form). The particle __бы__ typically follows the past participle or the first stressed word.

*   Formation: Past active participle (-в/-л/-ла/-ло/-ли) + particle __бы__.
*   _Examples:_ Я __читав бы__ (masc.) / __читала бы__ (fem.) ту книгу (I would read that book). Вон __ишов бы__ до кіна (He would go to the cinema). Мы __робили бы__ то все вєдно (We would do that all together). Что __бы__ вы __хотїли__? (What would you like?).
