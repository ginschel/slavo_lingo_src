## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Serbian language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'бити' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__бити__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The present tense forms are:

*   Ја __сам__ (I am)
*   Ти __си__ (You are, singular informal)
*   Он/Она/Оно __је__ (He/She/It is)
*   Ми __смо__ (We are)
*   Ви __сте__ (You are, plural or singular formal)
*   Они/Оне __су__ (They are)
*   _Examples:_ Ја __сам__ студент (I am a student). Моја сестра __је__ добра (My sister is good). Ми __смо__ добри пријатељи (We are good friends). Они __су__ овде (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Serbian nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __дом__ - house, __сто__ - table, __учитељ__ - teacher).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__а__ are feminine (e.g., __жена__ - woman, __књига__ - book, __земља__ - earth/land).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__о__ or -__е__ are neuter (e.g., __село__ - village, __море__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural forms vary based on gender.
    
    *   _Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __дом__. Pl: __домови__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __жена__. Pl: __жене__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __село__. Pl: __села__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __добар__ (m), __добра__ (f), __добро__ (n). Plural: __добри__ (all genders).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __тихи__ (m), __тиха__ (f), __тихо__ (n). Plural: __тихи__ (all genders).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Добар дом__ је стар (A good house is old). __Тихи ветар__ дува (A quiet wind is blowing). __Лепе жене__ говоре (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __овај__ (m), __ова__ (f), __ово__ (n) - (this, close to the speaker) / __тај__ (m), __та__ (f), __то__ (n) - (that, close to the listener) / __онај__ (m), __она__ (f), __оно__ (n) - (that, far from both)
*   __Plural:__ __ови__ (all genders) - (these) / __ти__ (all genders) - (those) / __они__ (all genders) - (those, far)
*   _Examples:_ __Овај__ дом је велик (This house is big). __Та__ књига је моја (That book is mine). __Ово__ је наше село (This is our village). __Ови__ људи су весели (These people are cheerful).
