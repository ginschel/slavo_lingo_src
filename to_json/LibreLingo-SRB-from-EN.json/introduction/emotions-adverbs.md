## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-о__ or __-е__.

*   _Examples:_ добро (well, from добар - good), брзо (quickly, from брз - quick), тихо (quietly, from тих - quiet), далеко (far).
*   _In sentences:_ Он говори __добро__ (He speaks well). Она трчи __брзо__ (She runs quickly). Живимо __далеко__ (We live far away).
