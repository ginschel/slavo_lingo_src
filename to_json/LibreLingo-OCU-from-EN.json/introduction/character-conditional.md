## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood. This is formed using the aorist forms of the verb __быти__ ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the __-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли__ form).

*   Aorist forms of 'быти': __бы́хъ, бы́, бы́, бы́ховѣ, бы́ста, бы́стѣ, бы́хомъ, бы́сте, бы́шѧ__
*   Formation: Aorist of 'быти' + Past active participle (-лъ/-ла/-ло/-ли)
*   _Examples:_ Азъ __бы́хъ чи́талъ__ (masc.) / __бы́хъ чи́тала__ (fem.) тоу книгѫ́ (I would read that book). Онъ __бы́ ѥдинъ шьлъ__ въ кино́ (He would go to the cinema alone). Мꙑ __бы́хомъ сътвори́ли__ сиѥ все вьсе́ѭ (We would do all this together). Чьто́ __бы́сте хотѣ́ли__? (What would you like?).
