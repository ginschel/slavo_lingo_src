## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-о__ or __-е__.

*   _Examples:_ до́брѣ (well, from добръ - good), бы́стро (quickly, from бы́стръ - quick), ти́хо (quietly, from ти́хъ - quiet), дале́че (far).
*   _In sentences:_ Онъ гово́ритъ __до́брѣ__ (He speaks well). Она́ бѣ́гаѥтъ __бы́стро__ (She runs quickly). Живе́мъ __дале́че__ (We live far away).
