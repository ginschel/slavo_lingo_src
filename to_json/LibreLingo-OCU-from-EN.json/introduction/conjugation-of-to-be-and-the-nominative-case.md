## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Old Church Slavonic language. OCS is an older stage of Slavic and has more complex features than modern Slavic languages, so understanding its structure is key.

## Conjugation of 'byti' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__быти__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. OCS has singular, dual (for two), and plural forms.

*   __Singular:__
    
    *   Азъ __ѥсмъ__ (I am)
    *   Тꙑ __ѥси__ (You are)
    *   Онъ/Она/Оно __ѥстъ__ (He/She/It is)
    
    
    
*   __Dual:__
    
    *   Вѣ __ѥсвѣ__ (We two are)
    *   Въі __ѥста__ (You two are)
    *   Онѣ/Она __ѥстѣ__ (They two are - masc/neuter / They two are - fem)
    
    
    
*   __Plural:__
    
    *   Мꙑ __ѥсмъ__ (We are)
    *   Вꙑ __ѥсте__ (You are)
    *   Они/Она __сѫтъ__ (They are - masc/neuter / They are - fem)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Азъ __ѥсмъ__ рабъ (I am a servant). Она́ __ѥстъ__ добра́ (She is good). Мꙑ __ѥсмъ__ добри раби (We are good servants). Они́ __сѫтъ__ сьде (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Old Church Slavonic nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun, as well as noun declension patterns. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a hard or soft consonant are masculine (e.g., __домъ__ - house, __столъ__ - table, __отьць__ - father, __мѫжь__ - man).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__а__ or -__ꙗ__ (after a soft consonant or vowel) are feminine (e.g., __жена́__ - woman, __книга__ - book, __землꙗ́__ - earth/land). Some nouns ending in a consonant are feminine (e.g., __нощь__ - night).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__о__ or -__е__ are neuter (e.g., __село́__ - village, __мо́ре__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with consonant-ending feminine nouns, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular, dual, and plural forms vary based on gender and declension class.
    
    *   _Hard Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __домъ__. Du: __дома__. Pl: __доми__.
    *   _Soft Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __мѫжь__. Du: __мѫжа__. Pl: __мѫжи__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __жена́__. Du: __женѣ__. Pl: __жены__. Sg: __нощь__. Du: __нощи__. Pl: __нощи__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __село́__. Du: __селѣ__. Pl: __села́__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender, number (singular, dual, plural), and case with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard (ь-stem) and soft (j-stem) stems, and also distinguish between definite and indefinite forms (which is a complex topic on its own). Here we show the simple/indefinite forms in the nominative.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Sg: __добръ__ (m), __добра__ (f), __добро__ (n). Du: __добра__ (m/n), __добрѣ__ (f). Pl: __добри__ (m), __добры__ (f), __добра__ (n).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Sg: __синь__ (m), __синя__ (f), __синѥ__ (n). Du: __синя__ (m/n), __сини__ (f). Pl: __сини__ (m), __синя__ (f/n).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Добръ домъ__ ѥстъ старъ (A good house is old). __Синѥ мо́ре__ ѥстъ велико (The blue sea is big). __Краснꙑ__ жєнꙑ́ говоратъ (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that." In the Nominative case, they also match the gender and number (singular, dual, plural) of the noun they refer to. Using them helps you specify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __сь__ (m), __сьꙗ__ (f), __си__ (n) - (this) / __онъ__ (m), __она́__ (f), __оно́__ (n) - (that - referring to something already mentioned)
*   __Dual:__ __сꙗ__ (m/n), __си__ (f) - (these two) / __она́__ (m/n), __онѣ__ (f) - (those two)
*   __Plural:__ __си__ (m), __сꙙ__ (f/n) - (these) / __они́__ (m), __она́__ (f/n) - (those)
*   _Examples:_ __Сь__ домъ ѥстъ великъ (This house is big). __Сьꙗ__ книга ѥстъ моꙗ́ (This book is mine). __Си__ село́ ѥстъ наше (This village is ours). __Си__ людиѥ сѫтъ весели (These people are cheerful).
