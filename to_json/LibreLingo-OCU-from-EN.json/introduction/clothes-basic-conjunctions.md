## Using Conjunctions: 'и', 'а', 'или'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __и:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Азъ __и__ тꙑ - I and you. Чи́тамъ __и__ пишѫ́ - I read and write.)
*   __а:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., Онъ ѥстъ оучи́тель, __а__ она́ ѥстъ оучени́ца - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Азъ идѫ́, __а__ тꙑ оста́ѥши сѧ - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __или:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Ка́ва __или__ ча́и? - Coffee or tea? Придѣ́те __или__ оста́нете сѧ дома́? - Will you come or stay at home?)
