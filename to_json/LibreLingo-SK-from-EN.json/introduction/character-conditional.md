## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood (podmieňovací spôsob). This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb __byť__ ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the __-l/-la/-lo/-li__ form).

*   Conditional forms of 'byť': __by som, by si, by, by sme, by ste, by__
*   Formation: Conditional 'byť' form + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __by som čítal__ (masc.) / __by som čítala__ (fem.) tú knihu (I would read that book). On __by šiel__ do kina (He would go to the cinema). My __by sme robili__ to všetko spolu (We would do that all together). Čo __by ste chceli__? (What would you like?).
