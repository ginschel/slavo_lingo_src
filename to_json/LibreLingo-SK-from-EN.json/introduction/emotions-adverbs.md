## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-o__, __-e__, or __-y__.

*   _Examples:_ dobre (well, from dobrý - good), rýchlo (quickly, from rýchly - quick), ticho (quietly, from tichý - quiet), ďaleko (far).
*   _In sentences:_ On hovorí __dobre__ (He speaks well). Ona beží __rýchlo__ (She runs quickly). Žijeme __ďaleko__ (We live far away).
