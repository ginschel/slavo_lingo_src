## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Slovak language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'byť' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__byť__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The present tense forms are:

*   Ja __som__ (I am)
*   Ty __si__ (You are, singular informal)
*   On/Ona/Ono __je__ (He/She/It is)
*   My __sme__ (We are)
*   Vy __ste__ (You are, plural or singular formal)
*   Oni/Ony __sú__ (They are)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __som__ študent. Moja sestra __je__ dobrá. My __sme__ dobrí priatelia. Oni __sú__ tu.

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Slovak nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a consonant are masculine (e.g., __dom__ - house, __stôl__ - table, __učiteľ__ - teacher).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ are feminine (e.g., __žena__ - woman, __kniha__ - book, __zem__ - earth/land).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__ or -__e__ are neuter (e.g., __mesto__ - city, __more__ - sea).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, but they apply to the majority of words.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural forms vary based on gender.
    
    *   _Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __dom__. Pl: __domy__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __žena__. Pl: __ženy__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __mesto__. Pl: __mestá__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __dobrý__ (m), __dobrá__ (f), __dobré__ (n). Plural: __dobrí__ (masculine animate), __dobré__ (other genders/non-masculine animate).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __cudzí__ (m), __cudzia__ (f), __cudzie__ (n). Plural: __cudzí__ (masculine animate), __cudzie__ (other genders/non-masculine animate).
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dobrý dom__ je starý (A good house is old). __Cudzie mestá__ sú zaujímavé (Foreign cities are interesting). __Krásne ženy__ hovoria (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __tento__ (m), __táto__ (f), __toto__ (n) - (this) / __ten__ (m), __tá__ (f), __to__ (n) - (that)
*   __Plural:__ __títo__ (masculine animate), __tieto__ (other genders/non-masculine animate) - (these) / __tí__ (masculine animate), __tie__ (other genders/non-masculine animate) - (those)
*   _Examples:_ __Tento__ dom je veľký (This house is big). __Tá__ kniha je moja (That book is mine). __Toto__ je naše mesto (This is our city). __Títo__ ľudia sú veselí (These people are cheerful).
