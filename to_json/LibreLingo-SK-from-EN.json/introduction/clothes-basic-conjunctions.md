## Using Conjunctions: 'a', 'i', 'alebo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __a:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On je učiteľ, __a__ ona je študentka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idem, __a__ ty ostávaš - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __i:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja __i__ ty - I and you. Čítam __i__ píšem - I read and write.)
*   __alebo:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Káva __alebo__ čaj? - Coffee or tea? Prídete __alebo__ ostanete doma? - Will you come or stay at home?)
