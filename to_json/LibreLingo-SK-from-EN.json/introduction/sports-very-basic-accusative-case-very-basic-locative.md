## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (koho or čo receives the action). The __Locative case__ is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __v__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidím __hrad__ - I see a castle, Vidím __mesto__ - I see a city)
    *   _Masculine Animate:_ Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidím __otca__ - I see a father)
    *   _Feminine:_ End in __-u__. (e.g., Vidím __ženu__ - I see a woman, Vidím __knihu__ - I see a book)
    
    
    
*   __Locative with 'na/v' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ Ends in __-e__ or __-u__. (e.g., na __stole__ - on a table, v __meste__ - in a city, na __poli__ - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ Ends in __-e__ or __-i__. (e.g., na __rieke__ - on a river, v __zemi__ - in the earth)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Čítam __knihu__ (I am reading a book). Sedíme __na stole__ (We are sitting on a table).
