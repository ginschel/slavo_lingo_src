## The Simple Past Tense (minulý čas)

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense (minulý čas). This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in __-l__ (for masculine singular), __-la__ (for feminine singular), __-lo__ (for neuter singular), or __-li__ (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding past tense form of the verb __byť__ is used for all persons _except_ the third person singular and plural, where it is optional but often used for emphasis.

*   Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    
    *   Masculine Singular: -__l__ (followed by appropriate form of _byť_) - On číta__l__ (He read)
    *   Feminine Singular: -__la__ (followed by appropriate form of _byť_) - Ona číta__la__ (She read)
    *   Neuter Singular: -__lo__ (followed by appropriate form of _byť_) - Ono číta__lo__ (It read)
    *   Plural (all genders): -__li__ (followed by appropriate form of _byť_) - Oni/Ony číta__li__ (They read)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Včera __som pracoval__ (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Včera ona __pracovala__ (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My __sme videli__ film (We saw a film). Oni __prišli__ neskoro (They arrived late).
