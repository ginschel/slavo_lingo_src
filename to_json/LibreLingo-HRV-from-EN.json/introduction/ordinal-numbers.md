## The ordinal numbers from 1 to 1000 are these:

*   1 prvi
*   2 drugi
*   3 treći
*   4 četvrti
*   5 peti
*   6 šesti
*   7 sedmi
*   8 osmi
*   9 deveti
*   100 stoti
*   1000 tisućiti

Like in the Interslavic explanation, these function grammatically like adjectives and decline accordingly.

To state the time of day, you typically use the preposition __u__ followed by the ordinal number in the Locative case and the word __sati__ (Locative case of "sat" - hour).

*   _Example:_ 8:45 -&gt; u osm__i__ sati četrdeset pet minuta - at eight forty-five.
