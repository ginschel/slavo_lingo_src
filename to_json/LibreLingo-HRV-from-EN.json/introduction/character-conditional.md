## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood (kondicional I). This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb __biti__ ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the __-o/-la/-lo/-li__ form).

*   Conditional forms of 'biti': __bih, bi, bi, bismo, biste, bi__
*   Formation: Conditional 'biti' form + Past active participle (-o/-la/-lo/-li)
*   _Examples:_ Ja __bih čitao__ (m.) / __bih čitala__ (f.) tu knjigu (I would read that book). On __bi išao__ u kino (He would go to the cinema). Mi __bismo radili__ to sve zajedno (We would do that all together). Što __biste htjeli__? (What would you like?).
