## Basic Accusative and Locative (Singular Only)

Let's start with a simplified look at two more cases in the singular. The __Accusative case__ often marks the direct object (who or what receives the action). The __Locative case__ (also called Prepositional) is used for location after prepositions like __na__ (on) or __u__ (in). For now, let's just see how simple singular nouns change (adjectives also change, but we'll keep it very basic here).

*   __Accusative (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine Inanimate &amp; Neuter:_ Look like the Nominative. (e.g., Vidim __stol__ - I see a table, Vidim __selo__ - I see a village)
    *   _Masculine Animate:_ Look like the Genitive (-a). (e.g., Vidim __oca__ - I see a father)
    *   _Feminine:_ End in __-u__. (e.g., Vidim __ženu__ - I see a woman, Vidim __knjigu__ - I see a book)
    
    
    
*   __Locative (Prepositional) with 'na/u' (Singular):__
    
    *   _Masculine/Neuter:_ Ends in __-u__. (e.g., na __stolu__ - on a table, u __gradu__ - in a city, na __polju__ - in a field)
    *   _Feminine:_ Ends in __-i__. (e.g., na __reci__ - on a river, u __zemlji__ - in the earth, u __školi__ - in a school)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Čitam __knjigu__ (I am reading a book). Sjedimo __na stolu__ (We are sitting on a table).
