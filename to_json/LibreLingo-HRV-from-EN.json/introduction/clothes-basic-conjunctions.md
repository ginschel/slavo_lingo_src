## Using Conjunctions: 'i', 'a', 'ili'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __i:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Ja __i__ ti - I and you. Čitam __i__ pišem - I read and write.)
*   __a:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On je učitelj, __a__ ona je studentica - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Ja idem, __a__ ti ostaješ - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __ili:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Kava __ili__ čaj? - Coffee or tea? Hoćete li doći __ili__ ostati kod kuće? - Will you come or stay at home?)
