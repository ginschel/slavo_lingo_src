## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense (perfekt). This is formed using the present tense forms of the verb __biti__ ('to be') and the past active participle of the main verb, which ends in __-o__ (masculine singular), __-la__ (feminine singular), __-lo__ (neuter singular), or __-li__ (plural).

*   Formation: Present tense of 'biti' + Past active participle (-o/-la/-lo/-li)
*   _Examples:_ Jučer __sam radio__ (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Jučer __je radila__ (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). Mi __smo vidjeli__ film (We saw a film). Oni __su stigli__ kasno (They arrived late).
