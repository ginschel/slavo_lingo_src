## Easy Comparisons: Više and Nego/Od

To make simple comparisons meaning 'more than', you often use a comparative adjective (like 'bolji' - better, 'veći' - bigger) followed by the word __nego__ or __od__ (than). The word __više__ generally means 'more' or 'a greater amount' and can be used with nouns in the genitive case or as a comparative adverb. It's also the comparative form of 'visok' (tall/high) in some contexts, but 'viši' is the standard comparative adjective form.

*   _Using nego:_ Moja knjiga je zanimljivija __nego__ tvoja (My book is more interesting than yours). On je stariji __nego__ ja (He is older than me).
*   _Using od:_ Moja knjiga je zanimljivija __od__ tvoje (My book is more interesting than yours). On je stariji __od__ mene (He is older than me).
*   _Using viši/više:_ Ta planina je __viša__ nego ono brdo (That mountain is higher than that hill). On je skočio __više__ od norme (He jumped more than the norm).
