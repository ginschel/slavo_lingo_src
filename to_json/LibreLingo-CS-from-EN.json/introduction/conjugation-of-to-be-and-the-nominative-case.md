## Welcome to the course!

This grammar explanation will be quite thorough, which is essential for understanding the Czech language, especially if you do not speak any Slavic language, as you might not easily grasp the logic behind certain grammatical structures otherwise.

However, if you are already familiar with a Slavic language and understand how to use the verb "to be," determine noun gender, and other fundamental concepts explained here, feel free to skip ahead.

## Conjugation of 'být' (To Be)

The verb "to be" (__být__) is essential for talking about existence or identity. Its present tense forms are used to say "I am," "you are," "he is," etc., or to indicate where something is located. The forms for the present tense are:

*   Já __jsem__ (I am)
*   Ty __jsi__ (You are, singular informal)
*   On/Ona/Ono __je__ (He/She/It is)
*   My __jsme__ (We are)
*   Vy __jste__ (You are, plural or singular formal)
*   Oni/Ony/Ona __jsou__ (They (masculine personal) are / They (feminine/inanimate/neuter) are)
*   _Examples:_ Já __jsem__ student (I am a student). Moje sestra __je__ dobrá (My sister is good). My __jsme__ dobří přátelé (We are good friends). Oni __jsou__ tady (They are here).

## How to Determine the Gender of a Word

Czech nouns belong to one of three genders: Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter. Knowing the gender is crucial because it affects the endings of adjectives and other words used with the noun. Generally, the gender is evident from the noun's ending in its basic form (nominative singular):

*   __Masculine:__ Most nouns ending in a hard or soft consonant are masculine (e.g., __hrad__ - castle, __stůl__ - table, __učitel__ - teacher, __muž__ - man).
*   __Feminine:__ Most nouns ending in -__a__ are feminine (e.g., __žena__ - woman, __kniha__ - book). Some nouns ending in a consonant are feminine (e.g., __věc__ - thing, __moc__ - power).
*   __Neuter:__ Most nouns ending in -__o__, -__e__, or -__í__ are neuter (e.g., __město__ - city, __moře__ - sea, __stavení__ - building).
*   _Keep in mind:_ There are some exceptions to these rules, especially with consonant-ending feminine nouns and some masculine nouns ending in vowels, where gender needs to be memorized.

## The Nominative Case: The Subject and Naming

The __Nominative case__ is the basic form of a noun or adjective, primarily used for the subject of a sentence (who or what performs the action) or simply to name things. This is the form you will find words in dictionaries.

*   __Nouns:__ Singular forms follow the gender rules described above. Plural forms vary based on gender and animacy for masculine nouns.
    
    *   _Hard Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __hrad__. Pl: __hrady__ (inanimate), __hrady__ (animate).
    *   _Soft Masculine Examples:_ Sg: __muž__. Pl: __muži__.
    *   _Feminine Examples:_ Sg: __žena__. Pl: __ženy__. Sg: __věc__. Pl: __věci__.
    *   _Neuter Examples:_ Sg: __město__. Pl: __města__. Sg: __moře__. Pl: __moře__.
    
    
    
*   __Adjectives:__ Agree in gender and number with the noun they describe. Adjectives have different endings for hard and soft stems.
    
    *   _Hard Stem Examples:_ Singular: __dobrý__ (m), __dobrá__ (f), __dobré__ (n). Plural: __dobří__ (masculine animate), __dobré__ (other genders/non-masculine animate).
    *   _Soft Stem Examples:_ Singular: __jarní__ (m/f), __jarní__ (n). Plural: __jarní__ (all genders). Soft adjectives have the same form for masculine and feminine singular.
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ __Dobrý dům__ je starý (A good house is old). __Jarní květiny__ jsou krásné (Spring flowers are beautiful). __Krásné ženy__ mluví (Beautiful women are speaking).

## Demonstrative Pronouns (Nominative) and Why Use Them

Demonstrative pronouns help us specify particular nouns, similar to using "this" or "that" in English. In the Nominative case, they must agree in gender and number with the noun they refer to. Using them helps to clarify exactly which item you mean from a group.

*   __Singular:__ __ten__ (m), __ta__ (f), __to__ (n) - (this/that)
*   __Plural:__ __ti__ (masculine animate), __ty__ (feminine/inanimate masculine), __ta__ (neuter) - (these/those)
*   _Examples:_ __Ten__ dům je velký (This/That house is big). __Ta__ kniha je moje (This/That book is mine). __To__ je naše město (This/That is our city). __Ti__ lidé jsou veselí (These/Those people are cheerful).
