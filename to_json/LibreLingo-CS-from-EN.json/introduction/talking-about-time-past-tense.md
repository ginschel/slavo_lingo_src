## The Simple Past Tense

Talking about actions that happened and finished in the past uses the simple past tense (prétéritum). This is formed using the past active participle of the verb, which ends in __-l__ (for masculine singular), __-la__ (for feminine singular), __-lo__ (for neuter singular), or __-li__ (for plural of all genders). The ending of this form changes to match the gender and number of the subject. The corresponding past tense form of the verb __být__ is used for all persons _except_ the third person singular and plural, where it is optional but often omitted in colloquial speech.

*   Subject Gender/Number determines ending:
    
    *   Masculine Singular: -__l__ (followed by appropriate form of _být_) - On čet__l__ (He read)
    *   Feminine Singular: -__la__ (followed by appropriate form of _být_) - Ona čet__la__ (She read)
    *   Neuter Singular: -__lo__ (followed by appropriate form of _být_) - Ono čet__lo__ (It read)
    *   Plural (all genders): -__li__ (followed by appropriate form of _být_) - Oni/Ony/Ona čet__li__ (They read)
    
    
    
*   _Examples:_ Včera __jsem pracoval__ (masc.) (Yesterday I worked). Včera ona __pracovala__ (fem.) (Yesterday she worked). My __jsme viděli__ film (We saw a film). Oni __přijeli__ pozdě (They arrived late).
