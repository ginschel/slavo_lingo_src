## Using Adverbs

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, telling us _how_, _when_, _where_, or _to what extent_ something happens. Many common adverbs are created from adjectives, often by changing the adjective ending to __-o__, __-e__, or __-ě__.

*   _Examples:_ dobře (well, from dobrý - good), rychle (quickly, from rychlý - quick), tiše (quietly, from tichý - quiet), daleko (far).
*   _In sentences:_ On mluví __dobře__ (He speaks well). Ona běží __rychle__ (She runs quickly). Žijeme __daleko__ (We live far away).
