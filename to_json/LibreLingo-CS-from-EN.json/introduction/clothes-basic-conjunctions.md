## Using Conjunctions: 'a', 'i', 'nebo'

Conjunctions are like connecting words that join words, phrases, or clauses. Three essential ones are:

*   __a:__ Primarily means "but" when showing a contrast, or can also mean "and" to connect related but slightly different ideas. (e.g., On je učitel, __a__ ona je studentka - He is a teacher, but she is a student. Já jdu, __a__ ty zůstáváš - I am going, and you are staying.)
*   __i:__ Simply means "and," connecting similar things. (e.g., Já __i__ ty - I and you. Čtu __i__ píšu - I read and write.)
*   __nebo:__ Means "or," offering an alternative. (e.g., Káva __nebo__ čaj? - Coffee or tea? Přijdete __nebo__ zůstanete doma? - Will you come or stay home?)
