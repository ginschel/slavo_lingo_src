## Conditional Forms: Saying "Would Do"

To talk about hypothetical situations or what someone "would do," you use the conditional mood (kondicionál). This is formed using the conditional forms of the verb __být__ ('to be') followed by the past active participle of the main verb (the __-l/-la/-lo/-li__ form).

*   Conditional forms of 'být': __bych, bys, by, bychom, byste, by__
*   Formation: Conditional 'být' form + Past active participle (-l/-la/-lo/-li)
*   _Examples:_ Já __bych četl__ (masc.) / __bych četla__ (fem.) tu knihu (I would read that book). On __by šel__ do kina (He would go to the cinema). My __bychom dělali__ to všechno společně (We would do that all together). Co __byste chtěli__? (What would you like?).
